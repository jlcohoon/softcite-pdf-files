Recently, we demonstrated the identification of several interacting partners with human small CTD phosphatase1 (hSCP1) and the substrate specificity to delineate an appearance of the dephosphorylation catalyzed by SCP1. In this study, using the established cells for inducibly expressing hSCP1 proteins, we monitored the modification of &#x003b2;-<italic>O</italic>-linked N-acetylglucosamine (<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc). <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications (PTMs). To gain insight into the PTM of hSCP1, we used the Western blot, immunoprecipitation, succinylayed wheat germ agglutininprecipitation, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, and site-directed mutagenesis and identified the Ser<sup>41</sup> residue of hSCP1 as the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification site. These results suggest that hSCP1 may be an <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated protein <italic>in vivo</italic>, and its N-terminus may function a possible role in the PTM, providing a scaffold for binding the protein(s).

Eukaryotic RNAPII has several (up to 52 in mammals) conserved tandem heptad repeats (Y<sup>1</sup>S<sup>2</sup>P<sup>3</sup>T<sup>4</sup>S<sup>5</sup>P<sup>6</sup>S<sup>7</sup>, namely C-terminal domain (CTD)) at its C-terminus that is not present in other RNAPs <xref rid="B003" ref-type="bibr">(3)</xref>. The phosphorylation of S<sup>2</sup> and S<sup>5</sup> of this repeat along with proline <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic> isomerization and glycosylation
creates a code that seemingly can be read to mediate a number of processes <xref rid="B004" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref>, <xref rid="B005" ref-type="bibr">5)</xref> and is thought to act as a scaffold to coordinate the binding of proteins involved in the different phases of transcription and couples the transcription with other nuclear process. Indeed, the phosphorylation status of this repeat is a hallmark for different transcriptional sdtages of the RNAPII complexes <xref rid="B006" ref-type="bibr">(6)</xref>. Thus, the enzymes responsible for the phosphorylation status of these serine (Sr) residues play pivotal roles in the regulation of transcription and related processes <xref rid="B007" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>. These events are largely mediated by the participation of the proline-directed kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases. Moreover, several phosphatases have been implicated for the removal of phosphates from the CTD, thereby mediating transitions in the transcription cycle <xref rid="B008" ref-type="bibr">(8</xref>, <xref rid="B009" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref>. A systematic approach investigating the genome-wide distribution of the CTD modifications indicated a considerable crosstalk between the CTD kinases and phosphatases, suggesting that the transcription operates in a uniform mode at virtually all the genes <xref rid="B010" ref-type="bibr">(10)</xref>.</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, small CTD phosphatases (SCPs) with activities preferential for phosphoryl-Ser<sup>5</sup> (<sup>P</sup>S<sup>5</sup>) were identified, containing a catalytic domain (FCPH domain) with Mg<sup>+2</sup>-binding DXDX(T/V) signature motif but lack a breast cancer protein related C-terminal domain <xref rid="B011" ref-type="bibr">(11</xref>,<xref rid="B012" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref>. The SCPs are related to the catalytic subunit of FCP1, the first discovered CTD phosphatase, which is highly conserved, essential enzyme for dephosphorylating the CTD of RNAPII and preferential for phosphorylating <sup>P</sup>S<sup>2</sup>. These are also transcriptional regulators for gene silencing activities in neuronal genes and phase regulation in the cell cycle <xref rid="B013" ref-type="bibr">(13</xref>,<xref rid="B014" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref>. The catalytic mechanisms of the SCPs and the structural basis for their CTD specificity are well understood <xref rid="B015" ref-type="bibr">(15</xref>,<xref rid="B016" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref>; however, the identity of physiological regulatory mechanisms explaining the biological activities of the SCPs has remained mainly elusive.</p><p>The &#x003b2;-<italic>O</italic>-linked N-acetylglucosamine (<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc) modification (<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation) has been proposed to act as a nutrient sensor and changes in response to many signals, including the morphogens, cell cycle, development, extracellular glucose levels, and numerous forms of cellular stress <xref rid="B017" ref-type="bibr">(17</xref>,<xref rid="B018" ref-type="bibr">18)</xref>. This modification of Ser and threonine (Thr) residues of various nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic proteins is one of a number of post-translational modifications (PTMs) thought to mediate cellular function, and a variety of proteins can be <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated <xref rid="B019" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref>. The <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is highly dynamic and interestingly regulates protein function in a manner analogous to the phosphorylation of protein by changing the localization of proteins, regulating protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, altering the half-life of proteins, and regulating the activity of proteins <xref rid="B020" ref-type="bibr">(20)</xref>. Taken together, it is well established that the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is a key PTM employed by the cells and animals to rapidly respond for the survival against stress.</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated the identification of several interacting partners with hSCP1 and the substrate specificity to delineate an appearance of the dephosphorylation reaction catalyzed by SCP1 phosphatase using a specific inducible expressing system of the human SCP1 (hSCP1) <xref rid="B021" ref-type="bibr">(21)</xref>. SCP1 protein subjected to diverse PTMs in spite of the known <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation of RNAPII <xref rid="B005" ref-type="bibr">(5)</xref>., particularly CTD, has not been reported. In this study, we interrogated the PTMs into this SCP1 as a CTD phosphatase and report hSCP1 as a target for the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation. The <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated hSCP1 peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry using the established NIH/3T3 cells expressing hSCP1 proteins under the tight control by doxycycline. Moreover, the intrinsically disordered N-terminal portion of SCP1 may provide a scaffold for binding the protein(s) involved in the PTM such as the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Establishment of NIH/3T3 cell lines for hSCP1</title><p>The active site of the CTD-phosphatases was characterized by the signature motif &#x003c8;&#x003c8;&#x003c8;DXDX(T/V)&#x003c8;&#x003c8;, where &#x003c8; is a hydrophobic residue. The D<sup>96</sup> in the hSCP1 has been shown to be catalytically pivotal. The <italic>hSCP1</italic> was tagged either with the Flag sequence at its N-terminus (5'-region) or V5 epitope sequence at its C-terminus (3'-region) and then subcloned into <italic>p</italic>TRE-IRES-EGFP mammalian inducible plasmid <xref rid="B021" ref-type="bibr">(21</xref>-<xref rid="B023" ref-type="bibr">23)</xref>. After the transfections of wild type (Wt) and D<sup>96</sup>N mutant <italic>hSCP1</italic> in <italic>p</italic>TRE-IRES-EGFP vector placing together <italic>p</italic>EF1&#x003b1;-Tet, several candidates were primarily chosen based on their antibiotic selection (puromycin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml) and microscopic appearance for the EGFP monitored into the IRES-driven EGFP expression in order for the expression to be tracked by fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>) and finally selected using the Western blot analysis with &#x003b1;-Flag and &#x003b1;-DYKDDDDK antibodies or &#x003b1;-V5 epitope antibodies in all the NIH/3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>). The selected and used expression clones in this study were shown to be &#x0ff1e;99% expression of the EGFP whenever they were induced by 2 &#x003bc;g/ml doxycycline as an inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>C). An increase in the hSCP1 expression was only shown in response to doxycycline depending on the induction time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>). However, after the treatment of doxycycline for the indicated periods of time, when the cells were replated on new culture dishes with fresh medium without the inducer, the hSCP1 finally reverted to no expression. Moreover, the immunoprecipitation analyses with 2 mg of the total cell lysates with appropriate antibodies did not show any positive signal from the noninduced cell lines. Thus, its expression was under the tight control of doxycycline and is a suitable, unique, and useful system for characterizing hSCP1. The established hSCP1 (Wt and D<sup>96</sup>N) inducible NIH/3T3 cells were designated as NIH/3T3/M2-hSCP1 and NIH/3T3/hSCP1-V5 for the N-terminal Flag-tagged hSCP1 and C-terminal V5-epiotpe tagged hSCP1, respectively. To confirm the enzymatic activities of the prepared recombinant hSCP1, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase activities of the immunocomplexes from the induced expressed hSCP1 (Wt) from the NIH/3T3 cells were measured by the enzymatic activity against the artificial substrate, para-nitrophenyl phosphate (<italic>p</italic>NPP) <xref rid="B021" ref-type="bibr">(21)</xref>, whereas those from the mutant hSCP1 (D<sup>96</sup>N) inducible cell lines did not show any activity. This is in a very good agreement with the previous reports. The preparation of the enzyme source for the SCP1 in the mammalian system is not reported. The production of a full-length version of recombinant SCP1 in the functional form under native conditions was not possible, primarily because of solubility issues <xref rid="B024" ref-type="bibr">(24)</xref>. Furthermore, even purifying the full-length form of the hSCP1 from <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system has also not been possible previously for another reason, because the protein consistently underwent proteolysis along the N-terminus during the expression <xref rid="B016" ref-type="bibr">(16)</xref>. The N-terminus was predicted to be structurally disordered, overcoming the biggest challenge of its solubility, because of the presence of the disordered N-terminus. The full-length SCP1 could only be purified under denaturing conditions followed by refolding. However, it had very little enzymatic activity remaining, and the N-terminus-truncated SCP1 purified under native conditions was functional <xref rid="B025" ref-type="bibr">(25)</xref>. In this study, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>C, only mutant hSCP1(D<sup>96</sup>N) from NIH/3T3/ hSCP1(D<sup>96</sup>N)-V5 cells had a slightly faster electrophoretic mobility than hSCP1 from NIH/3T3/hSCP1(Wt)-V5 and NIH/3T3/M2-hSCP1(Wt), and even hSCP1 from NIH/3T3/M2- hSCP1(D<sup>96</sup>N) cells. Hence, this truncation is likely because of specific proteolytic cleavage of the full-length hSCP1 and lability of the hSCP1(D<sup>96</sup>N) protein toward the proteolytic cleavage. However, the formation of the truncated version of hSCP1 was abolished, when the hSCP1 from NIH/3T3/ M2-hSCP1 cells was masked with the Flag-tag sequence in its N-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>C, lane 4). All together, these data indicate that our C-terminal tagged hSCP1(D<sup>96</sup>N) in the inducibly expressing cells (NIH/3T3/hSCP1-V5) was expressed as a truncated version of the hSCP1 protein at its N-terminal region. In fact, several reports have demonstrated that the N-terminus of the SCP1 is predicted to be structurally disordered and play a role of the intrinsically disordered N-terminus in the protein-protein interactions <xref rid="B026" ref-type="bibr">(26</xref>-<xref rid="B028" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref>.

In this study, we first addressed the question whether the hSCP1 is a target substrate of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). For this, immunologically confirmed epitope tagged hSCP1s (Wt and D<sup>96</sup>N) at different induction time points (0, 24, 48, 72 h) were used in the presence of Thiamet-G as an inhibitor of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcase, immunoprecipitated with either the &#x003b1;-Flag or &#x003b1;-V5 epitope antibody-conjugated Agarose beads and analyzed for the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation by Western blot analysis using &#x003b1;-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody (CTD110.6) at each induction time point. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figs. 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">3</xref>B, hSCP1 except the truncated hSCP1(D<sup>96</sup>N) from NIH/3T3/hSCP1-V5, lacking the N-terminal region, was modified by the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc. Most proteins undergo PTMs, which might be important for their function. Moreover, in many proteins, some regions are partially unstructured or even native folded under the physiological conditions. Furthermore, the cell lysates from each hSCP1-expressed cells were incubated with sWGA Agarose, a lectin that specifically interacts with terminal GlcNAc moieties. The sWGA precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using either &#x003b1;-Flag or &#x003b1;-V5 epitope antibody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Fig. 3</xref>C shows that also hSCP1 except the truncated hSCP1 (D<sup>96</sup>N) from NIH/3T3/hSCP1-V5 was detected in the sWGA precipitates, indicating that they carry <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc moiety in their N-terminus and is in a very good agreement with the previous immunoprecipitation result.</p><fig id="F0003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><title>Human SCP1 as a substrate target for O-GlcNAcylation.

After confirming the recombinant hSCP1 of the immunoprecipitate (1/30 volume) with &#x003b1;-DYKDDDDK antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Fig. 4</xref>B), the excised hSCP1 band was digested with Glu-C.

It is not clear whether the PTMs of the SCP1 phosphatases by enzymatic reactions are essential for their pathway. The PTMs create a highly dynamic relay system, responding to signaling events without requiring de novo protein synthesis and offer a platform for signaling pathway components involved in the regulation of the signaling system, hence providing alternative opportunities for targeting the specific signaling pathway.</p><p>In this study, we established clonal cell lines in which the expressions of hSCP1(Wt) and dominant negative hSCP1 (D<sup>96</sup>N) are under the tight control of an antibiotic, doxycycline as an inducer.

Although the functional role of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation on the N-terminal region of SCP1 such as the role of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated RNAPII CTD remains speculative, accumulating evidences indicate that the reversible PTMs such as <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation are mostly used to modulate the protein stability, allowing catalytic functions of the ordered proteins and is frequently used for the signaling activities of intrinsically disordered proteins. We believe that a novel <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated protein, hSCP1, identified in this study could function as a valuable resource for a further study of the role of RNAPII CTD phosphatases, a newly emerging family of phosphatases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and establishment of inducible hSCP1-expressing cell lines</title><p>NIH/3T3 cells were purchased from ATCC (Bethesda, MD, USA) and maintained in high glucose (25 mM) DMEM (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, USA) supplemented with 10% bovine serum and antibiotics (Life Technologies) in a humidified incubator at 37&#x02103; with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> as recommended by the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction.
