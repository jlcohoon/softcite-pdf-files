Outcomes in RoI and NI survivors were compared, stratifying into &#x02018;late disease&#x02019; (stage III/IV and any Gleason grade (GG) at diagnosis) and &#x02018;early disease&#x02019; (stage I/II and GG 2&#x02013;7).

RoI responders were younger; less often had comorbidities (45% vs 38%); were more likely to present asymptomatically (66%; 41%) or with early disease (56%; 35%); and less often currently used androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; 2%; 28%). Current prevalence of incontinence (16%) and impotence (56% early disease, 67% late disease) did not differ between RoI and NI. In early disease, only current bowel problems (RoI 12%; NI 21%) differed significantly in multivariate analysis. In late disease, NI men reported significantly higher levels of gynaecomastia (23% vs 9%) and hot flashes(41% vs 19%), but when ADT users were analysed separately, differences disappeared. For HRQoL, in multivariate analysis, only pain (early disease: RoI 11.1, NI 19.4) and financial difficulties (late disease: RoI 10.4, NI 7.9) differed significantly between countries. There were no significant between-country differences in DASS-21 or index ED-5D-5L score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment side effects were commonly reported and increased PCa detection in RoI has left more men with these side effects.

While a simple blood test and the prospect of earlier cancer diagnosis are appealing, poor specificity leads to overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant cancers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To be considered effective, screening must reduce overall and disease-specific mortality and morbidity and not just detect more disease. Only one large long-term randomised controlled trial has identified a significant reduction in deaths associated with Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) &#x02018;screening&#x02019;, but this was accompanied by a high level of overdiagnosis and associated treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite this, marked international variations in PCa incidence rates point to widespread use of PSA testing for unsuspected PCa<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and recent calls to offer men in their 40&#x02005;s access to the PSA test is likely to further increase numbers diagnosed.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the light of this, and in order to inform the PSA debate, it would be of value to determine whether more investigation and treatment improves men's self-reported health outcomes, especially in the long term.</p><p>Circumstances exist in Ireland where different intensities of PSA testing and subsequent biopsy between its two jurisdictions, Republic of Ireland (RoI) and Northern Ireland (NI), exist in populations which are similar in lifestyle and ethnic and genetic makeup.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Both jurisdictions have high-quality population-based cancer registries which have tracked PCa incidence since the early 1990s.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The RoI has a complex mixed public&#x02013;private healthcare system and rates of PSA testing in men aged 50 and older rose by 23% per annum between 1993 and 2005.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In 2006, the National Cancer Forum recommended against the introduction of PSA screening; however, high levels of testing persisted.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In contrast, NI has a predominantly publicly funded healthcare system similar to the NHS and has encouraged following the National Screening Committee's advice in 2002 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (2008) aimed at limiting the use of PSA testing in primary care.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Nevertheless, there is evidence of screening for PCa in the NI population,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> although at markedly lower levels (annual percentage change 1993 to 2003=+9.7%) than in RoI.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Consequently, since 1994, when PCa incidence rates were similar, the age-standardised incidence rate has risen by 222% in RoI compared with 161% in NI. These unique circumstances allow us to investigate the effect of more intense investigation and treatment of PCa on men's health and well-being.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This work was undertaken as part of the PiCTure (Prostate Cancer Treatment, <italic>your experience</italic>) study, which was conducted in RoI and NI, the methods of which have been described previously<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and in short are described below.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient involvement</title><p>Patients were involved in study steering group, piloting of questionnaire and interpretation of results.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants/patients</title><p>Following ethical approvals, a population-based sample of all men diagnosed with invasive PCa (International Classification of Diseases (ICD10 C61) between 1 January 1995 and 31 March 2010, and alive in November 2011, was selected from the two population-based cancer registries (n=22&#x02005;823). From this, a country and time (with approximately the same numbers under and over 5&#x02005;years since diagnosis) stratified random sample of 12&#x02005;322 men was selected. This was required as there were fewer survivors diagnosed in the earlier years for two reasons: one, the levels of PCa diagnosed were lower; and second, since at least 50% of PCa cases are over 70 when diagnosed, so mortality would have reduced numbers.</p><p>Patients' general practitioners/healthcare professionals were contacted to screen men for eligibility to participate in the study. Men were eligible if they were (1) alive, (2) aware of their PCa diagnosis, (3) well enough to receive and complete a questionnaire (in particular, had no cognitive impairment), (4) able to understand English and (5) resident in RoI or NI. Following this process, 6559 PCa survivors were deemed eligible to be sent a questionnaire. Questionnaires were posted in 2012. Non-responders received up to two written reminders.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome variables for this analysis were determined by questionnaire and were

Response options range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), except for the two questions comprising the GHS, responses to which ranged from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent).

Each subscale is based on seven questions with responses scored from 0 (did not apply) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most of the time). A summary score for each subscale was generated by doubling the sum of the individual responses. Possible scores on each scale range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression, anxiety or stress.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Explanatory variables</title><p>Men were asked to report all treatments received, by answering yes/no to a list of treatments (radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), active surveillance (AS), watchful waiting (WW) and brachytherapy (BT)).

Supplementary staging information was abstracted from medical records for NI respondents in early years when staging levels in the N. Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR) were low.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The goal of the analysis was to compare health and well-being between men from RoI and NI. However, the characteristics of the populations of patients with PCa and therefore the populations of survivors and respondents differed between RoI and NI, notably in the proportions of early and late disease. To overcome this, and since disease extent at diagnosis is likely to be an important determinant of health and well-being, analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were undertaken and outcomes were analysed separately for two main categories: &#x02018;late disease&#x02019; defined as stage III or IV and any GG at diagnosis and &#x02018;early disease&#x02019; defined as stage I/II and GG 2&#x02013;7 at diagnosis. A third group, &#x02018;other&#x02019;, which included those without stage or grade or with early stage and high grade, was also created and summary findings are reported for completeness.</p><p>Survey responses were weighted by age, country and time since diagnosis to compensate for higher non-response in certain survivor subgroups<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and increase representativeness of the results to the entire PCa survivor population.</p><p>Differences in proportions of patient characteristics, symptom and functional scores and DASS-21 subscales between survivors from NI and RoI were tested using z-tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests for early and late disease separately. Multivariate regression models (logistic for physical symptoms and linear for health utility, HRQoL and psychological well-being) were developed using a staged approach. The first model adjusted for age at questionnaire completion, number of comorbidities at diagnosis, time since diagnosis and method of diagnosis (model 1). The second model (model 2) then added treatments (RP, EBRT, BT, ADT) since treatment usage differs between RoI and NI. Records with missing treatment or method of diagnosis were dropped from all models (n=60).</p><p>Significance was at the 5% level with the Bonferroni correction applied to compensate for multiple comparisons (see table footnotes for details of significance levels for each analysis).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 3348 men responded, providing a 54% overall response rate after adjustment for men who were discovered to be ineligible following questionnaire dispatch.

This unique set of circumstances&#x02014;where clinicians in RoI undertake more PSA testing of asymptomatic men in primary care and refer more men to hospital for prostate biopsy, resulting in a considerably higher incidence of PCa than in NI&#x02014;has resulted in differences between countries in the profile of PCa, in terms of the sociodemographic characteristics of the men diagnosed, the distribution of disease stage and grade, and patterns of treatment usage<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> By examining patients with early and late disease separately, we are able to compare patient-reported outcomes between two similar populations with different levels of investigation and treatment. We found that while survivors from RoI were younger, with earlier disease and fewer comorbidities than those from NI, patient-reported outcomes were similar when stratified by disease extent at diagnosis; indeed, very few significant differences were found once adjustment had been made for patient characteristics and treatment.</p><p>The PCa-specific symptom reported as most distressing to men is urinary incontinence.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In this study, current urinary incontinence was reported by 15% of men who had been diagnosed with early disease and 20% of those with late disease, irrespective of jurisdiction and thus intensity of investigation. Erectile dysfunction is reported as a long-term irreversible side effect of treatment,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> especially following prostatectomy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The levels of erectile dysfunction&#x02014;56% in early disease and 67% in late disease&#x02014;were the same in responders from NI and RoI and are similar to those reported in other population-based surveys.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In patients with early disease, only bowel problems, a recognised side effect of radiotherapy,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> remained significantly higher in NI than in RoI, after adjustment for patient characteristics and treatments. Patients with cancers at other sites, including the colon and rectum, receive radiotherapy to the bowel area; however, colorectal cancer incidence rates and use of radiotherapy as treatment for this cancer are higher in RoI than in NI.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Physical symptoms associated with ADT&#x02014;breast changes, hot flashes and libido loss&#x02014;were reported with a similar frequency by men from NI and RoI with early disease but were significantly more common in patients with late disease from NI compared with those from RoI. The almost twofold higher levels of ever ADT reported by men from NI compared with men from RoI were taken into account in the multivariate analysis. We did not, however, have data on the duration, type or dose of ADT used which might have affected the patient-reported outcomes. We further note that no between-country difference was found when the subgroup of men currently on ADT were analysed separately (data not shown).</p><p>Outcomes related to HRQoL, including functioning, general cancer symptoms, health utility and psychological well-being, showed only minimal variations between survivors from RoI and NI; in multivariate analyses, pain was reported as higher in NI in patients with early disease; however, using internationally recognised scales, the observed difference in scores (between 19.4 and 11.1) would be considered only minimally clinically significant.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Pelvic pain is an acknowledged side effect of radiation treatment<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and this was reported more often by men from NI. This greater usage of radiation in NI, however, was accounted for in the multivariate analysis. The finding might be explained by higher levels of disease progression or poorer control of pain in NI. We did not collect information on recurrence or use of pain control and hence could not explore this further. The significantly higher level of financial difficulties identified by men from RoI is possibly a reflection of cancer-related out-of-pocket costs borne by patients in RoI. Previous work in RoI, which included PCa survivors, found that cancer-related financial stress and strain is common,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and this may be, in part, a function of the complex mixed public&#x02013;private healthcare system in operation. Other studies have shown associations between financial burden and psychological well-being and HRQoL among patients with cancer/cancer survivors.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>This may in part explain the lower, although not significant, GHSs reported by men in RoI compared with men from NI (although no differences were detected in DASS-21 outcomes).</p><p>Comparisons between countries with different policies and practices concerning PCa detection can make a valuable contribution to the debate on use of PSA to test for PCa. We have shown that patient-reported outcomes are very similar in RoI and NI despite different levels of PSA testing and diagnosed PCa. However, it is important to set these findings in the context of the wider population. It has been estimated that between 1994 and 2005, compared with the 1994 disease levels, there were 5938 &#x02018;extra&#x02019; cases of PCa diagnosed in RoI and 763 in NI.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Since 2005, the numbers of PCas in the two jurisdictions have continued to rise. As we have shown here and elsewhere, physical side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and incontinence, are common among prostate cancer survivors in Ireland,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> echoing studies in other settings.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These side effects can be viewed, in part, as a consequence of widespread PSA testing since, in the absence of testing, many of the men with side effects may never have been detected with PCa or, if they had been detected, this may have been at an older age, so they would have had to live less time with side effects. The burden of side effects, in terms of the numbers (and rates) of men in the population living with these, is greater in RoI than in NI (ie, higher in the population with higher levels of PSA testing). This important population-level health impact of more intensive PSA testing&#x02014;and the little (at best) impact of PSA testing on mortality<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02014;needs to be considered alongside the findings from the current analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Following 20&#x02005;years of higher levels of PCa detection in RoI than NI, when stage at presentation is taken into account, health outcomes among PCa survivors differed little between countries. However, the increased intensity of investigation has resulted in a population impact with many additional men in RoI having ongoing PCa-related physical symptoms, a risk for all areas with higher levels of testing.</p><p>Based on this evidence, the use of PSA to test high numbers of asymptomatic men as occurred in RoI has not reduced mortality compared with NI but has left many more men with side effects. We recommended that men be offered a PSA test only after informed discussion as recommended by current guidelines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the men who took the time to complete and return the questionnaire.
