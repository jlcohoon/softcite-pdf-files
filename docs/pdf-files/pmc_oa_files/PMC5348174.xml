It represents a major cause of mortality.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or tracheostomy positive pressure ventilation (TPPV) is usually used to treat neuromuscular disease with symptomatic hypoventilation.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Among these 2 methods, NIPPV has been widely recommended for patients with neuromuscular disease accompanied by chronic respiratory failure, since it not only reduces dyspnea and improves persistent hypoventilation, but it may also extend the life of individuals affected by this fatal disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Conversely, TPPV is used to treat ALS patients with severe bulbar palsy unable to maintain a proper level of CO<sub>2</sub> via NIPPV.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Among the parameters of mechanical ventilation, the tidal volume is one of the more important parameters. Over the past decades, the tidal volume of invasive ventilation has progressively decreased, from greater than 12 to 15&#x0200a;mL/kg to less than 9&#x0200a;mL/kg of the actual body weight in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS).<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Currently, there are guidelines that strongly support the use of a lower tidal volume (i.e., 6&#x0200a;mL/kg predicted body weight) in patients with ALI/ARDS.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> However, there is no consensus on the optimal initial tidal volume for patients without ALI/ARDS, especially in ALS.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Moreover, a lower tidal volume may cause atelectasis due to insufficient ventilation in patients with respiratory muscle weakness, such as ALS. As a result, clinicians who are not experts on ventilator settings may experience difficulty in using ventilators, which may lead to inappropriate application.</p><p>Therefore, in efforts to determine the appropriate ventilator settings, we retrospectively evaluated the values used in home ventilators for patients with ALS, and had a stable level of CO<sub>2</sub> on both the arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) and transcutaneous blood gas monitoring (Sentec AG, Therwil, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This retrospective, single-center study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee. A total of 71 patients with ALS and respiratory failure, who were ventilator dependent at home and at the rehabilitation department, between June 2010 and December 2015, were included for evaluation. To reduce bias due to the ventilator mode, patients with ALS receiving a volume control mode (AC mode) with home ventilator Triology 100 (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA) was investigated in our study. Home ventilators were applied to all patients using an unvented circuit. Home ventilators were applied to patients at our clinic when they exhibited symptoms of respiratory insufficiency and hypercapnia, defined as partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub> and PtCO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003e; 45&#x0200a;mm Hg via arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) and transcutaneous blood gas (PtCO<sub>2</sub>) analysis; SenTec Digital Monitor System with V-Sign Sensor was used for the latter (Sentec AG, Therwil, Switzerland).<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Patients were routinely admitted when they needed to control the ventilator setting, and ABGA and PtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring was performed during admission. The ABGA was performed routinely at 6 AM to evaluate night time hypercapnia. Moreover, PtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring was performed continuously for more than 48&#x0200a;hours before and after the application of the ventilator. In our clinic, NIPPV via a nasal mask was applied initially to patients with hypercapnia. If the nasal mask was insufficient, they switched to a facial mask to improve respiratory insufficiency and hypercapnia. In addition, TPPV was applied when respiratory insufficiency and hypercapnia were not improved by NIPPV. In TPPV, a cuffed tracheostomy tube with 10 to 20&#x0200a;mm Hg of cuff pressure was used in our clinic.</p><p>We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients to investigate the appropriate ventilator parameters for patients with ALS. The following parameters of ventilators were successfully collected: ventilator mode, inspired tidal volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>Ti</sub>), actual minute ventilation (MV), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), and inspiratory time (<italic>T</italic><sub>ins</sub>). The presence of sustained clinical improvement with normal pH (&#x02265;7.35 and &#x02264;7.45), PtCO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> (&#x02264;45&#x0200a;mm Hg and &#x02265;35&#x0200a;mm Hg), and oxygen saturation (&#x02265; 90%), in addition to the lack of atelectasis in chest imaging (chest x-ray and CT) were required to be considered as successful TIPPV or NIPPV.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> In addition, the following parameters were also collected for every patient: age, actual body weight (ABW), predicted body weight (PBW) calculated using height (Male; [height(cm) &#x02013; 152.4] &#x000d7; 0.91 + 50, female; [height (cm) &#x02013; 152.4] &#x000d7; 0.91 + 45.5), presence of tracheal tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy (PEG), and duration of ventilator usage per day (in&#x0200a;hours).

Unlike other neuromuscular diseases, ALS patients with pronounced bulbar symptoms often experience difficulty with NIPPV. Moreover, patients with ALS tend to have a faster disease progression. As disease progresses, it is not uncommon to change the ventilator application from NIPPV to TPPV in patients with ALS. Therefore, it may be unreasonable for patients with ALS to blindly undergo protocols and ventilator settings of other neuromuscular diseases uniformly, despite the existence of some protocols that outline the initial ventilator settings for neuromuscular disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, the equations using PBW for the calculation of an appropriate tidal volume were more accurate than ABW. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that the tidal volume based on PBW is more useful in predicting tidal volume than ABW.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, the categorized MV as well as <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub> were calculated.

Such a misunderstanding may arise since low PIP, despite sufficient <italic>V</italic><sub>Ti</sub> could be developed in the following 2 cases: (1) patients with a lot of leakage volume and (2) patients with relatively sufficient respiratory muscle strength. Therefore, it is important to check not only PIP and <italic>V</italic><sub>Ti</sub>, but also <italic>V</italic><sub>Te</sub> or MV. As such, in the application process of home ventilators, it may be helpful if a clinician knew in advance of the appropriate tidal volume and MV using these equations, especially in patients with TPPV. Moreover, MV might be more useful in the initial settings regardless of the disease course, simply because MV tends to remain relatively constant, unlike other parameters, that is, worsening respiratory muscle weakness, decreased spontaneous breathing, and increased duration of ventilator usage, which are associated with neuromuscular disease progression.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, <italic>V</italic><sub>Ti</sub> and MV showed no statistically significant correlations with both PBW and ABW in the NIPPV group. This result shows that there may be a significant amount of air leakage through the facial mask. Since the leakage volume varies widely depending on the facial structures or the severity of the bulbar palsy, it is very difficult to quantify the leakage volume. Interestingly, however, PIP in 5 ALS patients remained similar even after changing the ventilator application from NIPPV to TPPV (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In addition, there was no significant difference in PIP between the NIPPV and TPPV groups (NIPPV, 16.55&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;4.29 (minimum 8.8&#x02013;maximum 25.0); TPPV, 14.44&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;4.76 (minimum 10.0&#x02013;maximum 27.4). These results suggest that PIP can be a relatively constant and important parameter when compared with <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub> regardless of the severity of bulbar palsy during the initial application of NIPPV or when changing the ventilator from NIPPV to TPPV in patients with ALS.</p><p>Our present study had some limitations. First, only a small number of patients with various stages of ALS were included for evaluation. The leakage volume, which is affected by the degree of bulbar palsy, may have influenced our results. However, we tried to reflect the degree of disability by using a modified Ranke scale and by grouping patients based on the the ventilator application methods. Moreover, ALS is relatively rare, and encountering patients with such a disease and receiving ventilator treatment are even rarer. Considering the scarcity of neuromuscular diseases, this study might still be meaningful despite the small number of patients included for evaluation. Further studies that incorporate a greater number of patients with the same disease may be necessary. To analyze the effective usefulness of the categorized MV or <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub> in the initial setting of home ventilator, a future prospective study may be necessary. Second, we only included TPPV and NIPPV with facial masks, not including those with mouthpieces and nasal masks. We were unable to quantify the leakage volume due to the retrospective nature of this study, especially in the NIPPV group. Therefore, we did not include NIPPV with mouthpieces or nasal masks to minimize the variable of leakage volume. In NIPPV, nasal masks are not recommended in an acute setting because it tends to lead to mask failure in &#x0003e;72% of subjects and seems to lower CO<sub>2</sub> to a lesser extent compared with facial masks.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In the case of mouthpieces, despite its comfort, there is a greater risk of hypoventilation.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Further studies that include other various types of ventilators might be helpful to better compare the effectiveness of each type. Lastly, we only included 5 ALS patients who underwent a change in the ventilator application from NIPPV to TPPV. Although 5 ALS patients showed interesting results with relatively constant PIP, even after changing the ventilator application, we were unable to generalize this finding in patients with ALS due to this limitation. However, the findings of this study showed that PIP may be an important parameter in ventilator settings regardless of the leakage, especially when NIPPV is applied to patients with ALS. In addition, it will be helpful to know the differences of setting values between TPPV and NIPPV, especially because ALS patients are usually treated with TPPV due to the initial difficulties associated with NIPPV. Further long-term clinical trials with larger numbers of patients are required to confirm these findings in this study.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with ALS, appropriate management planning, including the use of TPPV or NIPPV, may reduce morbidity and mortality, and prevent the loss of lung compliance and atelectasis. In this study, equations using PBW, compared with those using ABW, were shown to be more accurate. This finding is consistent with previous studies. In NIPPV, <italic>V</italic><sub>Ti</sub> and MV had no significantly positive correlations with both PBW and ABW. However, PIP can be a relatively constant and important parameter compared with <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub>, regardless of the severity of bulbar palsy during the initial application of NIPPV or when changing the ventilator application from NIPPV to TPPV in patients with ALS; a further prospective study may be necessary to confirm such findings. Moreover, it will be helpful to understand the differences of setting values between TPPV and NIPPV, especially because ALS patients are usually treated with TPPV due to the initial difficulties associated with NIPPV.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully appreciate MRCC team of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for their work in the area of statistics in this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ABGA = arterial blood gas analysis, ABW = actual body weight, ALI/ARDS = acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CT = computed tomography, MRC = medical record council, MV = minute ventilation, NIPPV = noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, PBW = predicted body weight, PEEP = positive end expiratory pressure, PEG = percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy, PIP = peak inspiratory pressure, <italic>T</italic><sub>ins</sub> = inspiratory time, TPPV = tracheostomy positive pressure ventilation, <italic>V</italic><sub>Ti</sub> = inspired tidal volume.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (NRF-2013R1A1A1004622).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Oana</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Mukherji</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>
