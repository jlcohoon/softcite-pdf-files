Retention of cells delivered to the heart is generally &#x0003c;10% after several hours, regardless of the cell type and administration route. This may explain, at least in part, the small and inconsistent therapeutic benefit seen in clinical trials of bone marrow-derived stem cells for acute myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, novel approaches are required to concentrate regenerative cells (either exogenous or endogenous) to their targets, and to engage them with the diseased tissue.</p><p>Here we apply targeted nanomedicine to achieve <italic>in vivo</italic> cell-mediated tissue repair, imaging and localized enrichment without cellular transplantation.

In rats with MI, intravenously infused MagBICE concentrates in injured heart muscle, as visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, MagBICE captures circulating bone marrow-derived stem cells or endogenous CD34-positive cells and concentrates these cells in the injured heart tissue, reducing scar formation and improving pump function. Targeting can be further enhanced by magnetic attraction, leading to augmented functional benefits. Thus, we have achieved significant therapeutic efficacy, rivaling that of conventional cell therapy, with a novel intravenously infused nanoparticle. The magnetic nanomatchmaker concept is generalizable to a wide variety of disease targets.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Synthesis of MagBICE and physicochemical properties</title><p>The concept of MagBICE is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. Ferumoxytol (trade name: Feraheme (FH))<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> is an iron nanoparticle coated with a carboxylated dextran polymer, enabling antibodies to be bound covalently by activating the carboxyl (COOH) groups with water-soluble carbodiimide 1-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) reagent. The resultant active ester reacts with primary amines on the antibodies of interest. The first MagBICE particle tested here (MagBICE<sub>1</sub>) was generated by conjugating anti-CD45 and anti-MLC antibodies to FH. Unconjugated FH and MagBICE<sub>1</sub> were visualized by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), with clear identification of the iron core and, for MagBICE<sub>1</sub>, the bound antibodies. The conjugation of both antibodies was further confirmed by immunofluorescent secondary antibodies targeting the primary antibodies on MagBICE<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The reduction of antibody concentration (measured by SDS PAGE and A280) in the post-conjugation solution confirms conjugation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Compared with FH, MagBICE<sub>1</sub> has a slightly larger size (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 95.7&#x000b1;14.5&#x02009;nm versus 25.2&#x000b1;5.0&#x02009;nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) but a similar zeta potential (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: &#x02212;9.6&#x000b1;1.5&#x02009;mV versus &#x02212;5.2&#x000b1;4.2&#x02009;mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The addition of antibody linkers did not significantly change the slightly negative zeta-potential of FH, which is generally suitable for intravenous applications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding and engaging activities <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The ability of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> to bind specifically to stem cells and injured heart muscle cells, and conjoin the two, was investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> using rat bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>), flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>) and Prussian blue iron staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>) confirmed that MagBICE<sub>1</sub> bound efficiently to rat BMCs, whereas unconjugated FH did not. An antibody stripping protocol ruled out any significant endocytosis of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> by BMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). NRCMs were lightly permeabilized to mimic membrane disruption secondary to ischemic injury; this maneuver exposes MLC, which is normally confined to the intracellular compartment. MagBICE<sub>1</sub> bound to injured NRCMs, whereas unconjugated FH did not (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 69.5&#x000b1;14.0% versus 1.5&#x000b1;2.3% fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-positive NRCMs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k</xref>). Binding was specific to injured cells, as MagBICE<sub>1</sub> did not bind to healthy NRCMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). To demonstrate conjoining, rat BMCs were co-cultured with injured NRCMs, in the presence of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> or FH. MagBICE<sub>1</sub>, but not FH, increased the number of BMCs attaching to injured cardiomyocytes (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 9.0&#x000b1;1.7 versus 1.8&#x000b1;1.9 DiD-labelled BMCs per high power field (HPF), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>). A scrambled control of MagBICE<sub>null</sub> (FH conjugated with rabbit and mouse IgG isotype control antibodies) neither bound to injured NRCMs nor engaged them with BMCs, indicating that the binding/engaging effects of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> are specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). The presence of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> did not affect NRCM viability (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 6.8&#x000b1;3.2% versus 7.0&#x000b1;2.5% EthD-positive dead cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), BMC proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) or BMC migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), indicative of minimal cytotoxicity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding and engaging activities <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To test the injury-targeting and cell-engaging abilities of MagBICE<sub>1</sub>
<italic>in vivo</italic>, MI was created by ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Cardiac MRI revealed that intravenously-delivered MagBICE<sub>1</sub> efficiently targeted to the injured myocardium, creating a signal void in T2* weighted MRI images (yellow arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Unconjugated FH created a &#x02018;hypointensity&#x02019; much smaller than MagBICE but slightly greater than that in the control group. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed the binding of MagBICE<sub>1</sub>, but not FH, to the infarct zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Here we utilized a goat-FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody to detect the rabbit anti-CD45 antibody on MagBICE<sub>1</sub>. Specific FITC fluorescence was evident in the infarct zone of the MagBICE<sub>1</sub>-treated animals. High magnification revealed the globular morphology of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> (as detected by fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>)) and its presence on the surface of cardiomyocytes (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The iron core of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> was visualized by Prussian blue staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Binding specificity was confirmed by the absence of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> in non-infarcted (remote) myocardium. MagBICE<sub>1</sub> infusion resulted in an increase of CD45-positive cells in the infarct area (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 11.7&#x000b1;3.6 versus 1.9&#x000b1;1.9 cells per HPF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). MagBICE<sub>1</sub> did not exacerbate inflammation in the post-MI heart: the numbers of CD68-positive macrophages (magenta, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) were similar in the three experimental groups. The majority of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> (green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) was bound to cardiomyocytes, although some had been internalized by macrophages as indicated by FITC (MagBICE<sub>1</sub>)/CD68 double-positive cells. <italic>In vitro</italic>, internalization of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> by isolated rat macrophages was minimal, as compared with larger iron beads (positive control) designed for endocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). There was no sign of iron overload: infusion of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> did not elevate serum transferrin or ferritin levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 9 and 10</xref>), nor was there excessive free iron in the liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional benefits of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> for BMC therapy</title><p>Is MagBICE infusion capable of therapeutic cell targeting and regeneration of the injured tissue? To address this question, MagBICE<sub>1</sub> or FH was infused intravenously in rats with acute MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Twenty minutes later, 2 million syngeneic DiI-labelled BMCs were infused to create circulating labelled stem cells. MagBICE<sub>1</sub> increased BMC targeting (red DiI signal) to the heart while decreasing off-target fluorescence in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), as confirmed by histology showing that MagBICE<sub>1</sub> boosted the number of BMCs in the infarct zone (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 33.1&#x000b1;14.7 versus 3.7&#x000b1;1.7 cells per HPF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). BMCs (red) coated with MagBICE<sub>1</sub> were generally co-localized with injured cardiomyocytes (green) in the infarct zone. Although fluorescent molecules leftover from dead BMCs may be taken up by the surrounding cells, the DiI fluorescence should still represent the amount of BMCs that were originally recruited (either dead or alive at 24&#x02009;h). The engineered stem cell targeting and cell&#x02013;cell coupling produced by MagBICE<sub>1</sub> led to therapeutic benefit. Masson's trichrome staining distinguishes viable tissue (red) from scar (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Compared with the control group, scar mass was reduced (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 23.6&#x000b1;7.2 versus 43.9&#x000b1;6.2&#x02009;mg), as was scar size (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 16.3&#x000b1;4.9% versus 35.1&#x000b1;10.4%; expressed as a percentage of the total left ventricular (LV) mass). Meanwhile, infarct wall thickness was greater (that is, better preserved) with MagBICE<sub>1</sub>+BMC infusion (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 0.85&#x000b1;0.22&#x02009;mm versus 0.41&#x000b1; 0.13&#x02009;mm). Global pump function, as gauged by LV ejection fraction (LVEF), was indistinguishable among all three groups at baseline (24&#x02009;h after MI), indicating similar degrees of injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>; left, white bars). Four weeks later, LVEF was higher in MagBICE<sub>1</sub>+BMC infused animals than in those that had received saline infusion (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 41.6&#x000b1;6.7% versus 26.7&#x000b1;2.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>; left, black bars). Indeed, saline infusion had a negative treatment effect with decreasing LVEFs over time, whereas MagBICE<sub>1</sub>+BMC robustly preserved heart function (right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Unconjugated FH+BMC infusion was not different from saline infusion in any measures, indicating that cell targeting to the injury zone is essential to therapeutic benefits. Histology revealed that MagBICE<sub>1</sub>+BMC infusion promoted angiogenesis as compared with the control group (mean&#x000b1;s.d.: 47.0&#x000b1;11.4 versus 15.3&#x000b1;4.7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>), a well-known mechanism of benefit in BMC-based therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, more cardiomyocytes were present in the peri-infarct area of MagBICE<sub>1</sub>-treated hearts, consistent with <italic>de novo</italic> cardiomyogenesis and/or better preservation of cardiomyocytes at-risk after acute MI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional benefits of MagBICE<sub>2</sub> with magnetic targeting</title><p>We next sought to address two new questions: (i) Is MagBICE capable of enriching endogenous stem cells in the infarct area and exerting therapeutic benefits similar to those of cell transplantation? (ii) Is the iron core of MagBICE potentially useful not only for imaging but also for physical enrichment by applying an external magnet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>? To address these questions, we created another MagBICE (MagBICE<sub>2</sub>) by conjugating anti-CD34 and anti-MLC antibodies to FH. MagBICE<sub>2</sub> specifically binds to injured cardiomyocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). When delivered intravenously to rats post MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), MagBICE<sub>2</sub> homed to injured myocardium as evidenced by the localized MRI signal void (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, MagBICE<sub>2</sub>). Targeting was further enhanced by local application of a magnetic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, MagBICE<sub>2</sub>+M). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated 24&#x02009;h after delivery of MagBICE<sub>2</sub>; some PBMCs bound to the nanoparticles, with further enrichment by magnetically activated cell sorting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Flow cytometry revealed these cells to be predominantly CD34 positive. Four weeks after treatment with MagBICE<sub>2</sub>, endogenous CD34 cells were enriched in the heart (7.8&#x000b1;2.6 cells per HPF versus 3.6&#x000b1;1.8 in saline controls or 3.1&#x000b1;1.6 with FH infusion). Such binding was further boosted by magnetic targeting (to 15.4&#x000b1;5.1 cells per HPF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Administration of MagBICE<sub>2</sub> with magnetic targeting resulted in the greatest preservation of viable tissue in the risk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and the highest cardiac function (LVEF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>) at 4 weeks. Although treatment with MagBICE<sub>2</sub> improves outcomes even without magnetic targeting, focused physical attraction clearly enhances efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Currently, there are &#x0003e;30 Food and Drug Administration-approved antibody therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, including 10 blockbuster drugs. Most are for cancer therapy, for example, antibodies designed to recruit cytotoxic T cells to cancer cells. The latter principle utilizes the simpler entity of bispecific T-cell engager<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, which consists of fused monoclonal antibody fragments without a magnetic core. MagBICE and bispecific T-cell engager are similar in that both exploit conjoined antibodies to achieve molecular co-localization. Bispecific proteins and antibodies have also been used to enhance stem cell targeting and tissue regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. MagBICE, however, differs fundamentally from bispecific antibodies in that the iron core enables visualization of tissue localization by MRI and enhancement of targeting efficacy by local magnetic fields. These features may overcome some of the limitations of conventional cell therapy, including uncertainties in biodistribution and poor cell retention, even with local delivery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Systemic delivery by intravenous infusion is minimally invasive, but suffers from paltry homing to the target organ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Two prototypes of MagBICE target systematically delivered stem cells or endogenous stem cells to injured heart tissue, generating sizable therapeutic outcomes not dissimilar to those seen in preclinical models of direct BMC transplantation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Compared with a previous report using bispecific antibody-armed BMCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, our technology represents a qualitative step forward. First, the manipulating agent needs not be pre-armed with BMCs <italic>in vitro</italic>; instead, MagBICE can capture endogenous BMCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, as we have shown with MagBICE<sub>2.</sub> Moreover, the iron nanocore enables detection by MRI and physical (magnetic) enrichment. Our study also has several limitations. First, the hypoenhancement created by iron may distort the quality of MR images during the initial period after infusion. The degradation and absorption of iron should mitigate this problem over time. Second, MagBICE<sub>2</sub> alone produces only marginal functional benefit, further emphasizing the utility of synergistic magnetic targeting. It is possible that insufficient CD34<sup>+</sup> cells are available in the circulation for MagBICE to capture, limiting therapeutic efficacy. We have not yet tested whether adjunctive bone marrow-stimulating agents such as granulocyte&#x02013;colony-stimulating factor might enhance MagBICE efficacy, but such a conjecture merits future investigation. Third, in our study, MagBICE was delivered immediately after reperfusion in rats. In many clinical scenarios, a later time point of administration may be more realistic, but we have not yet studied the effects of delayed administration. Finally, we did not include a MagBICE<sub>null</sub> group in our animal studies. The nonspecific binding effects of MagBICE <italic>in vivo</italic> warrant further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, magnetic antibody-linked nanomatchmakers enable molecular targeting, physical enrichment and noninvasive imaging all in one easily synthesized particle. By varying the antibodies and/or adding a drug payload onto the iron core, the strategy is broadly generalizable. Moreover, translatability to patients should be straightforward, given that both the iron nanocore and the recombinant human antibodies are widely utilized clinically.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Preparation and characterization of MagBICE</title><p>MagBICE<sub>1</sub> was generated by conjugating rabbit anti-CD45 (Abcam) and mouse anti-MLC (Abcam) antibodies.

Saline (400&#x02009;&#x003bc;l PBS), unconjugated FH (10&#x02009;mg iron per kg body weight in 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;l PBS) or MagBICE (10&#x02009;mg iron per kg body weight in 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;l PBS) was intravenously infused through tail veins. Twenty-four hours after infusion, MRI of the heart was accomplished by a gradient echo sequence to produce a T<sub>2</sub>* weighting with a Bruker Biospec 9.4T small animal MRI system (Bruker). A 60-mm diameter linear transmit/receive coil (Bruker, T10325V3) was utilized for excitation and a 4-channel array coil (Bruker, T10324V3) designed for rat heart imaging was used for improved signal-to-noise data acquisition. The pulse sequence details are the repetition time (TR): 5.1&#x02009;ms; the echo time (TE): 2.4&#x02009;ms; the flip angle (FA): 8.0&#x000b0;. Retrospective gating was accomplished with Bruker IntraGate software (Bruker) to produce ten cine images for each slice. In addition, one coronal cine image was acquired, which dissected the heart to verify the presence of iron particles. Iron signal intensity was quantified from the transverse images with NIH ImageJ software and normalized to adjacent tissues. After the imaging session, animals were euthanized and 8-&#x003bc;m-thick heart cryo-sections were prepared using a microtome. To visualize the retention of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> particles in the heart and its co-localization with cardiomycytes, the sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeablized/blocked with Protein Block Solution (DAKO) containing 1% saponin (Sigma) and stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (to detect the primary antibodies on MagBICE<sub>1</sub>) and alpha-sarcomeric actin (Abcam; detected by Texas-Red-conjugated secondary antibodies). Images were taken by a Leica TCS SP5 X confocal microscopy system. The targeting efficiency of MagBICE<sub>1</sub> was quantified by the FITC signal intensity normalized to the Texas-Red signal intensity of the same field, using the Leica LAS AF Software. The presence of iron was further confirmed by tissue Prussian blue staining<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Slides were also stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 (Abcam) or Cy5-conjugated anti-CD68 antibodies (Abcam) to evaluate whether MagBICE<sub>1</sub> targets endogenous cells and/or exacerbated inflammation in the post-MI heart. To examine whether endogenous stem cells are captured by infused MagBICE<sub>2</sub> (CD34-Fe-MLC), PBMCs were isolated from unconjugated FH- and MagBICE<sub>2</sub>-infused animals using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation 24&#x02009;h after treatment.
