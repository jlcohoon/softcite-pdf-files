The authors examined the cerebral perfusion differences among 17 Parkinson disease (PD) patients, 17 PD with dementia (PDD) patients, and 17 healthy controls and used ASL-MRI to assess the effects of dopaminergic therapies on perfusion in the patients. The authors demonstrated progressive widespread cortical hypoperfusion in PD and PDD and robust effects for the dopaminergic therapies. Specifically, dopaminergic medications further decreased frontal lobe and cerebellum perfusion in the PD and PDD groups, respectively. These patterns of hypoperfusion could be related to cognitive dysfunctions and disease severity. Furthermore, desensitization to dopaminergic therapies in terms of cortical perfusion was found as the disease progressed, supporting the concept that long-term therapies are associated with the therapeutic window narrowing. The highly sensitive pharmaceutical response of ASL allows clinicians and researchers to easily and effectively quantify the absolute perfusion status, which might prove helpful for therapeutic planning.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with the progressive loss of dopamine neurons, and incidence studies suggest that an annual rate of 10% of PD patients develop dementia (which is sometimes termed PD with dementia (PDD) in such cases).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of the rate of disease deterioration is essential for the design and evaluation of new therapies for this disorder. Current neuroimaging studies, including MRI and radiotracer studies (positron emission tomography, PET; single photon emission computed tomography, SPECT) have identified abnormally decreased levels of cortical metabolism and perfusion in PD.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Such alterations have been associated with the PD motor-related pattern and the PD cognitive-related pattern,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> suggesting that they could potentially be used as disease biomarkers to assess disease diagnoses, progression, and treatment responses in cases of PD.</p><p>Although enormous progress has been made in the treatment of PD, including the development of a variety of promising therapies, long-term dopamine replacement therapies as well as the progression of the disease itself might be associated with the gradual development of ineffective motor functional control, the occurrence of adverse drug effects,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and various cognitive impairments.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The association between the direct effects of dopaminergic therapies on brain global/regional perfusion and disease status remains unclear. A previous study, however, has reported that as dementia develops in PD patients, those patients exhibit more widespread cortical hypoperfusion.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> By altering dopaminergic neurotransmission, dopaminergic therapy can modulate the cognitive and motor striatal functional networks in healthy individuals and in PD patients.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The spatiotemporal progression of dopamine depletion in PD provides a special model for assessing dopaminergic effects on perfusion in neural systems with different baseline dopamine levels.</p><p>Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive MRI perfusion tool that quantitatively measures cerebral blood flow per unit of tissue mass by taking advantage of arterial water as a freely diffusible tracer.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Arterial spin labelling allows for the acquisition of perfusion data without the fear of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with significant renal insufficiency. The ability to obtain quantification on an absolute scale further allows for easy recognition of diffuse hypoxic/anoxic states and also for assessments of cortical perfusion before and after a given intervention.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Unlike processes involving the use of potentially harmful radioactive materials that require long preparation times, ASL can also be easily repeated in routine MRI studies to safely and effectively investigate disease status and progress in PD. Recent studies have demonstrated its clinical applications in cerebral blood flow quantification in PD.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>We had 3 priori hypotheses for our study: ASL-MRI would indicate cortical hypoperfusion in the subjects with PD and PDD as compared with the normal controls (NC); dopaminergic therapy might alter acute cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in particular brain regions in PD and PDD; and differences in regional perfusion resulting from pharmaceutical effects would predict the baseline or interval changes indicated during clinical evaluations. Our results might help prove the utility of ASL in defining a time window for early interventions against PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital human research committee.

Patients were included if they had a definitive diagnosis of idiopathic PD<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and had been followed up on at the Neurology Out-Patient Clinic for more than 6 months after titration of their daily dopaminergic medications to a steady dose in accordance with their clinical symptoms. The PDD was diagnosed in accordance with recently published guidelines.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Patients were excluded if they had newly diagnosed PD or had undergone follow-ups for less than 6 months since their daily dose of dopaminergic medications was still under adjustment; other pyramidal signs, severe sensorial impairment, or ataxia; or impaired consciousness or higher brain dysfunction that precluded following instructions.</p><p>All the patients completed 3 tests corresponding to the ON and OFF medication states. All evaluations for the PD and PDD patients, including evaluations of clinical disease status, MRI studies, and neuropsychological tests, were initially assessed in the OFF state achieved by withdrawal of dopaminergic medications 12 to 18 hour before testing. For the ON testing, the study procedures began 1 hour after the patient had taken their daily dopaminergic medications. The daily dose of dopaminergic medications was converted into the equivalent dose of levodopa.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The disease severity and functional status of each patient were evaluated, as in our previous study,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the modified Hoehn and Yahr stages, and the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale.

In particular, we also found evidence of dosage-dependent pharmaceutical effects of the dopaminergic therapies on cerebral perfusion in different vulnerable brain regions in the PD and PDD patients. Furthermore, by linking the immediate changes in CBF before and after dopaminergic treatment with measurements of disease severity and cognitive functions, we demonstrated that the effects of dopaminergic therapies on cortical perfusion might be reduced as the disease progresses. Our results highlight the potential value of using ASL as a global marker of overall impairment and for therapeutic monitoring in PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathophysiology of Hypoperfusion in Parkinson Disease and Parkinson Disease With Dimentia</title><p>Our results showed extensive cortical perfusion deficits in the PDD patients, regardless of whether those patients were in the ON or OFF status, as well as mild decreases in perfusion in the occipital and cerebellar regions in the PD group patients when they were in the ON status. The neuroimaging findings of past studies regarding cortical perfusion alterations have varied. Although multiple pathophysiologies support the conclusion that perfusion changes occur in PD, differences in the patient populations studied (ie, in terms of sample size, disease severity, and medication status), different data-analysis procedures, and differences in the statistical criteria selected have led to differences among the observations of different studies. Using a relatively optimal and strict analysis threshold combined with various meta-analyses, Borghammer <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> recently concluded that PD most likely results in widespread cortical hypometabolism, even at early disease stages.</p><p>The underlying mechanism of the extensive reduction of cortical CBF in PD patients remains unknown. The well-known pathologic process in PD is the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway, with the consequent reduction of dopamine in the striatum. In addition, Braake <italic>et al</italic> have proposed that the early degeneration of various subcortical structures corresponding to different neuronal systems, including dopaminergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic networks, occurs in PD.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Since those neuronal systems are widespread and connected to different subregions of the striatum and neocortices, it is reasonable that parallel neurodegenerative depletion of these neuron populations and an extensive decrease in cortical perfusion would be observed. Another piece of evidence for an association between the number of existing neurons and cortical perfusion was provided by several studies, in which chemical and electrical stimulations of those neural systems were used to elicit significant increases in regional and global CBF and vasodilatation (Borghammer <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>). Our PDD results showing extensive cortical hypoperfusion may well represent the profound loss of neurons involved in these neuronal systems.</p><p>Another finding indicating that no region exhibited hypoperfusion in PD patients in the OFF status seems contradicted by previous reports. There, however, has been some speculation that the cortical hypoperfusion reported in PET and SPECT studies is actually because of a difference in the calculations caused by gray matter atrophy.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In a previous ASL study, regions with cortical perfusion deficits were found to overlap to a high degree with areas of gray matter volume loss determined by voxel-based morphometry.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The major concern regarding perfusion measurements comes from the low degree of spatial resolution and the lack of morphologic information imaging modalities. Since nearly all of the previous PET and SPECT studies of PD did not employ partial volume correction, the results of the current study indicating no obvious cortical hypoperfusion in PD are probably strengthened by the use of PVC, which would lessen the confounding influence of cortical atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results are comparable to those of the existing literature showing that the magnitude of the cortical perfusion decreases in PD are somewhat diminished following PVC.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Nevertheless, another argument is that the cortical hypoperfusion can probably only be partially explained by atrophy.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Lots of volumetric studies have demonstrated no loss of gray matter or less extensive clusters of atrophy in early-stage PD subjects.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In addition, PD exhibits altered functional connectivities, which have previously been shown to be associated with changes in regional/global neurovascular coupling and hemodynamic responses and can precede structural changes.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> At present, it is difficult to use a single etiology to completely explain cortical hypoperfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmaceutical Effects of Dopaminergic Therapies on Cortical Perfusion</title><p>Comparisons of cerebral blood flow between PD<sub>OFF</sub> versus PD<sub>ON</sub> and PDD<sub>OFF</sub> versus PDD<sub>ON</sub> revealed decreased perfusion after the administration of dopaminergic medications in brain regions that are known to be functionally and anatomically connected to different subregions of the striatum.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the current study, dopaminergic medications significantly decreased inferior frontal lobe perfusion in PD patients as well as cerebellar perfusion in PDD patients. These diminished perfusion levels were partially in line with a previous functional MRI study indicating that the functional connectivities between the ventral striatum, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the cerebellum were down-regulated by levodopa. That study also, however, found hyperconnectivity in patients with levodopa OFF status compared with controls,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> whereas the cortical perfusion was decreased in the current study. Compared with the normal subjects, the PD<sub>ON</sub> patients showed hypoperfusion in the precuneus and occipital lobes, findings which were somewhat similar to previous results indicating that levodopa disrupts ventral striatal and dorsal caudate functional connectivity with the default mode network in healthy adults.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It is still difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the relationship between changes in regional cortical perfusion and the cortico-striatal functional network during dopaminergic medication. According to previous reports, the pathologic state of dopamine depletion is associated with increased synchronous oscillatory activity in the cortico-striatal networks.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In contrast, dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation were demonstrated to eliminate these increases in coherent neural activity across networks with clinical improvement.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The decrease in cortical perfusion might thus reflect a decrease in the energetic need for cortico-cortical synchronous oscillatory activity after dopamine resupply.</p><p>Specifically, we found that dopaminergic therapy reduced cortical perfusion in different anatomies in the PD and PDD groups. According to the Braak model, alpha synuclein is deposited in specific brain regions and neuronal types, giving rise to Lewy pathology in a stereotypic, temporal pattern that ascends caudo-rostrally from the lower brainstem through susceptible regions of the midbrain and forebrain and into the cerebral cortex.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In addition, a recent study reported that brain atrophy occurs in early PD in inferior frontal regions related to primary olfactory and/or secondary integrative olfactory processing, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, frontal lobe hypometabolism might exceed gray matter atrophy in the early stages of PD with mild cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Therefore, treatment effects in early PD might substantially contribute to the down regulation of fronto-striatal hyperconnectivity with subsequent lessening of the need for cortical perfusion in the frontal lobe.</p><p>Our results were consistent with those of a previous study showing a decline of frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal perfusion in PDD<sub>OFF</sub> patients compared with the PD<sub>OFF</sub> patients.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> This can be explained by the fact that PD is associated with better dopaminergic function reserves in the fronto-striatal and mesolimbic system than PDD is. Increasing evidence suggests that the major role of the cerebellum in PD is likely to include both pathologic and compensatory effects. In contrast to the functioning of the frontal lobes, which present in the preclinical or early stages of PD with lesions and corresponding frontal lobe symptoms, the pseudo-normal cerebellar functioning of PD patients is actually because of a balance between the effects of lesions, compensation by the cerebellum, and dopaminergic effects.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Strengthened connections between cortico-cerebellar motor regions have previously been shown to counterbalance weakened striatal-cortical and striatal-cerebellar connections to compensate for basal ganglia dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Extensive neocortical degeneration with a decrease number of dopamine neurons in PDD weakens the capacity to respond to the dopaminergic treatment with neocortical perfusion. Therefore, a compensatory increase in the cortico-cerebellar connections or a hyperactive cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop in PDD may help to maintain better motor and nonmotor functions. Levodopa had been shown to decrease functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and cerebellum,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which might be associated with cerebellar hypoperfusion in PD<sub>ON</sub> patients. Nonetheless, further research is needed to support this concept.</p></sec><sec><title>Desensitization to the Effects of Dopaminergic Therapies on Cortical Perfusion as the Disease Progresses</title><p>The disabling &#x0201c;on-off&#x0201d; fluctuations are among the most frequent and troublesome complications of chronic levodopa therapy in PD. In addition to investigating the responses of the main anatomies to dopaminergic medications, we also explored whether alterations in their cortical perfusion were inversely related to dosages. Furthermore, higher disease severities, including poorer motor and cognitive functions, were strongly associated with lower cortical perfusion responses to dopaminergic medications even after controlling for differing dosages of the medications. Our results were compatible with the general concept that supplying dopamine pharmaceutically over a long period of time is associated with a narrowing of the therapeutic window.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The G protein-coupled receptors phosphorylation and down regulation can be associated with a loss of response to dopaminergic treatments when a given drug is administered repeatedly.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Since PD and PDD both revealed an inversed dosage related cortical perfusion response, the desensitization of dopaminergic receptors might partially explain the current findings.</p><p>In addition, our perfusion results might indicate deteriorating presynaptic functions of dopamine neurons because of a decrease in dopamine neuronal survival. Dopaminergic drugs, such as levodopa, are potentially toxic to dopaminergic neurons.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Two studies of patients with PD have evaluated the effect of levodopa compared with a dopamine agonist on surrogate neuroimaging biomarkers of dopamine neuronal function.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Levodopa was demonstrated to be associated with an accelerated rate of decline in biomarker activity compared with the dopamine agonist.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Although dosage-related perfusion changes were observed in both the PD and PPD groups, a significant correlation between perfusion changes and disease severity was only found among the PDD subjects. It is possible that these findings might have resulted from a differential pharmacological effect of the drug on target receptors, since early PD patients are more likely to take dopamine agonists whereas PDD patients are more likely to take levodopa.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Nevertheless, our result might simply reflect the natural degeneration process of PD. Such an effect, however, was difficult to clarify in the current study.</p><p>The interpretation of the findings here must be tempered by some of the limitations of the current study. First, the number of subjects was relatively small. It is possible that our results could not be regenerated in all disease spectrums. There were also mild imbalances in the mean age and mean disease duration for the PD and the PDD patients who might have confounded the statistical analysis. Our results need to be replicated. Much larger sample sizes may permit the identification of perfusion effects specific to degeneration versus dementia subpopulations. Furthermore, the direct effect of different dopaminergic medications on cortical perfusion and their characteristic patterns in this study are unknown because all medicated patients were assessed and imaged with no disruption to their normal drug regimens. Since all the patients underwent MRI scanning under a stable medication control condition (ie, when continuing the same dopaminergic medications for at least 3 months), our group contrasts reveal different disease severities rather than different medication effects. This topic awaits further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, we noninvasively explored PD- and PDD-related cortical blood flows via ASL. The perfusion patterns were characterized by extensively decreased neocortical and preserved subcortical perfusion. The development of dementia in PD further worsens the perfusion status. In addition, the highly sensitive temporal responses to the direct effect of dopaminergic medications shown by ASL allow clinicians and researchers to easily, safely, and effectively quantify the absolute perfusion values. The availability and repeatability of ASL might prove useful for therapeutic planning and offer a useful platform for translation research, particularly in clinical trials of new antiparkinsonian therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-95-e2206-s001.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1010" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AFNI = Analysis of Functional NeuroImages, ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, ASL = arterial spin labeling, BET = Brain Extraction Tool, CBF = cerebral blood flow, DARTEL = Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra, FLIRT = FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool, GLM = general linear model, MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination, MNI = Montreal Neurological Institute, NC = normal controls, PD = Parkinson disease, PDD = Parkinson disease with dementia, PET = positron emission tomography, PVE = partial volume effect, SPECT = single photon emission computed tomography, SPM = statistical parametric mapping, UPDRS = Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by funds from Chang Gang Memorial Hospital (Chang Gang Medical Research Project CMRPG891511 and CMRPG8B0831 to W-C Lin) and from the National Science Council (NSC101-2314-B-182A-078 to W-C Lin).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goetz</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Emre</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubois</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group>
