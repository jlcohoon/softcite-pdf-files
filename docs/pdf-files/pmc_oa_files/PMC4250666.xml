Two major cell types that are actively involved in the remodeling of alveolar bone are osteoblasts and osteoclasts. They are sensitive communicators between microenvironment and genome, capable of restoring system homeostasis disturbed by orthodontic mechanics.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Under the load of orthodontic forces, many molecular reactions occur in and around these cells. However, the mechanism of these reactions has not been fully elucidated. A more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism will provide valuable information for the development of agents regulating the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts to better control the bone resorption in compression areas, which is the rate-limiting step in orthodontic tooth movement.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Some effectors of bone remodeling have been reported, and one of the most well-studied molecular networks in this process is the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) pathway.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Osteoblasts can regulate osteoclast differentiation via this pathway. OPG is one of the rate-limiting agents for osteoclast differentiation and function,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> since it can block the membrane docking of RANK and RANKL. Recently, another family of molecules known as ephrin/Eph has been demonstrated to modulate the differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Similar to RANK and RANKL, ephrins and Ephs have a ligand-receptor relationship-ephrins are transmembrane ligands, and Ephs are tyrosine kinase receptors. Interaction between ephrinB- and EphB-expressing cells results in bidirectional signal transduction. The activation of EphB receptors by ephrinB ligands is referred to as "forward signaling", whereas the activation of ephrinB ligands by EphB receptors is designated "reverse signaling". Ephrin and Eph were characterized initially through their roles in embryogenesis,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> as ephrin-Eph signaling is critically involved in neural development, cell morphogenesis, tissue patterning, and angiogenesis.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Within the ephrin/Eph family, EphB4 and its preferred ligand, ephrinB2, have been studied intensively in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. EphrinB2 expression is induced during osteoclast differentiation, and then reverse signaling through this ligand suppresses osteoclast differentiation, forming a negative feedback loop.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Moreover, forward signaling through the EphB4 receptor on osteoblasts enhances their differentiation. The bidirectional activation of the ephrinB2-EphB4 signaling pathway in osteoclasts and osteoblasts leads to the suppression of osteoclast differentiation with concurrent stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and, consequently, bone formation. The communication between ephrinB2 and EphB4 has recently been shown to be involved in the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation within the osteoblast lineage.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, ephrinB2 and EphB4 have been demonstrated to be regulated by mechanical forces in endothelial progenitor cells and periodontal ligament fibroblasts.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It was shown that mechanical strain induced ephrinB2 upregulation in periodontal ligament fibroblasts, contributing to osteogenesis at tension sites of orthodontic tooth movement.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, the effects of compressive force on these two molecules in osteoblasts and osteoclasts have not been clearly elucidated.</p><p>Our objective was to investigate the involvement of ephrinB2 in periodontal tissue remodeling in compression areas during orthodontic tooth movement and the effect of compressive force on ephrinB2 and EphB4 expression in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We hypothesized that compressive force would affect alveolar bone remodeling through the regulation of ephrinB2 and EphB4 expression during orthodontic tooth movement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and stromal cell line ST2 were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank (Shanghai, China). A four-point bending system was obtained from Sichuan University (Chengdu, China).

The animals used were 8-week-old male Wistar rats, with an average weight of 200 g. The rats were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with 0.2 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> Sumianxin (Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, China). A nickel-titanium closed-coil spring exerting an orthodontic force of 50 cN was ligated unilaterally to the maxillary first molar and incisor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The maxillary first molar on the opposite side was not moved and was used as the control group. We examined a total of 10 teeth in five rats.

The maxillae were dissected and molar-bearing segments of alveolar bone were cut from each side and further fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde buffer. The specimens were decalcified in 10% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid solution (pH 7.4) for 8 weeks, and further dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Serial 5-&#x000b5;m-thick sections including the crestal areas mesial and distal to the maxillary molars were cut and mounted on L-poly-lysine-coated glass slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry was performed. For immunohistochemistry staining, endogenous peroxidase in the tissue section was blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes and then further blocked with 1% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 minutes. The primary antibody used was polyclonal rabbit anti-human ephrinB2. An immunohistochemistry staining kit (Maixin Bio, Fuzhou, China) was used for further staining. Finally, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Negative controls were labeled using the same procedures, but omitting the incubation with primary antibodies. Staining density was analyzed using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) and represented as the mean density.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>RAW264.7 cells were maintained in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (L-DMEM; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and ST2 cells in alpha-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 100 U&#x000b7;mL<sup>-1</sup> penicillin, and 100 mg&#x000b7;mL<sup>-1</sup> streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37&#x02103; in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

EphrinB2 was examined by immunohistochemistry; however, since no osteoblasts were found in the compression area, EphB4 expression was not assessed. We observed strong expression of ephrinB2 in osteoclasts, suggesting that this ligand may be involved in periodontal tissue remodeling in the compression area during orthodontic tooth movement. However, it is unknown whether the applied orthodontic force directly induced this cellular reaction. To clarify this point, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study was performed to investigate the effects of compressive force on ephrinB2 and EphB4 in cultured osteoblasts and osteoclasts.</p><p>The direct effect of mechanical force on osteoclast differentiation<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> has previously been investigated in only a few studies. These yielded limited information, as many analyses were done using primary cultured bone cells, which were mixtures of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and other undifferentiated cells. In the present study, by analyzing changes in the gene expression of NFATc1 and CTR in RAW 264.7 cells we provided direct evidence that compressive force can promote osteoclast differentiation.</p><p>It has been found that ephrinB2, but not EphB4, is present in multinucleated osteoclasts and differentiating mononuclear osteoclasts.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> As such, only ephrinB2 was examined in RAW264.7 cells in our study. Moreover, it has been reported that ephrinB2 expression is induced and upregulated during osteoclast differentiation. This molecule is markedly expressed at later stages of osteoclast differentiation, and its induction is dependent on NFATc1 and the proto-oncogene c-Fos. In our study, osteoclast differentiation was promoted by compressive force and accompanied by an increase in ephrinB2 expression. Our results therefore support previous findings.</p><p>Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are two major types of bone cells that are responsible for bone remodeling. These two types of cells can communicate with each other via ephrinB2-EphB4 bidirectional signal transduction. In addition, self-communication within osteoblasts is also possible because osteoblasts can express both ephrinB2 and EphB4. In our study, EphB4 and ephrinB2 expression in ST2 cells was downregulated by compressive force. This downregulation would attenuate ephrinB2-EphB4 signaling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, as well as within the osteoblast lineage. Consequently, osteoblast differentiation and subsequent bone formation via the ephrinB2-EphB4 signaling pathway would be attenuated, which could facilitate bone resorption in compression areas of alveolar bone during orthodontic tooth movement.</p><p>EphrinB2 has been demonstrated to be induced by the c-Fos-NFATc1 transcriptional cascade in osteoclasts, and is expressed at a later stage of osteoclast differentiation.
Furthermore, EphB4-ephrinB2 reverse signaling through ephrinB2 suppresses c-Fos-NFATc1 transcription and osteoclast differentiation, forming a negative feedback loop.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In our study, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> ephrinB2 expression was induced by compressive force as well as osteoclast differentiation, which is consistent with previous studies.</p><p>The molecular genetic processes underlying orthodontic
tooth movement function as a feedback system of checks and balances.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Activator molecules beget suppressor molecules and then return to their steady states, and examples of this system include tumor necrosis factor and its receptor, colony stimulating factor-1, OPG, and RANK and RANKL.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> EphrinB2 and EphB4 could be added to this list of regulatory molecules, as our findings suggest they regulate bone resorption during orthodontic tooth movement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>EphrinB2 and EphB4 are regulated by compressive force in osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and therefore may participate in the transduction of compressive force into osteoclastogenesis in compression areas during
