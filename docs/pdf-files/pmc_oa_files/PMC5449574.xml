The provision of outpatient care contributes to immediate and large gains in health status, and a large portion of total health expenditure goes to outpatient healthcare services. Payment method is one of the most important incentive methods applied by purchasers to guide the performance of outpatient care providers.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To assess the impact of different payment methods on the performance of outpatient care facilities and to analyse the differences in impact of payment methods in different settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Search methods</title><p>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2016, Issue 3, part of the Cochrane Library (searched 8 March 2016); MEDLINE, OvidSP (searched 8 March 2016); Embase, OvidSP (searched 24 April 2014); PubMed (NCBI) (searched 8 March 2016); Dissertations and Theses Database, ProQuest (searched 8 March 2016); Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (searched 8 March 2016); IDEAS (searched 8 March 2016); EconLit, ProQuest (searched 8 March 2016); POPLINE, K4Health (searched 8 March 2016); China National Knowledge Infrastructure (searched 8 March 2016); Chinese Medicine Premier (searched 8 March 2016); OpenGrey (searched 8 March 2016); ClinicalTrials.gov, US National Institutes of Health (NIH) (searched 8 March 2016); World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched 8 March 2016); and the website of the World Bank (searched 8 March 2016).</p><p>In addition, we searched the reference lists of included studies and carried out a citation search for the included studies via ISI Web of Science to find other potentially relevant studies. We also contacted authors of the main included studies regarding any further published or unpublished work.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection criteria</title><p>Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series, and repeated measures studies that compared different payment methods for outpatient health facilities. We defined outpatient care facilities in this review as facilities that provide health services to individuals who do not require hospitalisation or institutionalisation. We only included methods used to transfer funds from the purchaser of healthcare services to health facilities (including groups of individual professionals). These include global budgets, line-item budgets, capitation, fee-for-service (fixed and unconstrained), pay for performance, and mixed payment. The primary outcomes were service provision outcomes, patient outcomes, healthcare provider outcomes, costs for providers, and any adverse effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted a structured synthesis. We first categorised the comparisons and outcomes and then described the effects of different types of payment methods on different categories of outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis within a study if a study included more than one indicator in the same category of outcomes. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis across studies. If the data for meta-analysis were not available in some studies, we calculated the median and interquartile range. We reported the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the relative change for continuous outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Main results</title><p>We included 21 studies from Afghanistan, Burundi, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, and the United States of health facilities providing primary health care and mental health care. There were three kinds of payment comparisons.</p><p>1) Pay for performance (P4P) combined with some existing payment method (capitation or different kinds of input-based payment) compared to the existing payment method</p><p>We included 18 studies in this comparison, however we did not include five studies in the effects analysis due to high risk of bias. From the 13 studies, we found that the extra P4P incentives probably slightly improved the health professionals' use of some tests and treatments (adjusted RR median = 1.095, range 1.01 to 1.17; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably led to little or no difference in adherence to quality assurance criteria (adjusted percentage change median = -1.345%, range -8.49% to 5.8%; moderate-certainty evidence). We also found that P4P incentives may have led to little or no difference in patients' utilisation of health services (adjusted RR median = 1.01, range 0.96 to 1.15; low-certainty evidence) and may have led to little or no difference in the control of blood pressure or cholesterol (adjusted RR = 1.01, range 0.98 to 1.04; low-certainty evidence).</p><p>2) Capitation combined with P4P compared to fee-for-service (FFS)</p><p>One study found that compared with FFS, a capitated budget combined with payment based on providers' performance on antibiotic prescriptions and patient satisfaction probably slightly reduced antibiotic prescriptions in primary health facilities (adjusted RR 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.96; moderate-certainty evidence).</p><p>3) Capitation compared to FFS</p><p>Two studies compared capitation to FFS in mental health centres in the United States. Based on these studies, the effects of capitation compared to FFS on the utilisation and costs of services were uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' conclusions</title><p>Our review found that if policymakers intend to apply P4P incentives to pay health facilities providing outpatient services, this intervention will probably lead to a slight improvement in health professionals' use of tests or treatments, particularly for chronic diseases. However, it may lead to little or no improvement in patients' utilisation of health services or health outcomes. When considering using P4P to improve the performance of health facilities, policymakers should carefully consider each component of their P4P design, including the choice of performance measures, the performance target, payment frequency, if there will be additional funding, whether the payment level is sufficient to change the behaviours of health providers, and whether the payment to facilities will be allocated to individual professionals. Unfortunately, the studies included in this review did not help to inform those considerations.</p><p>Well-designed comparisons of different payment methods for outpatient health facilities in low- and middle-income countries and studies directly comparing different designs (e.g. different payment levels) of the same payment method (e.g. P4P or FFS) are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Payment methods for outpatient care facilities</title><p><bold>Review aim</bold></p><p>The aim of this Cochrane review was to assess the effect of different payment systems for outpatient care facilities. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and included 21 studies.</p><p><bold>Key messages</bold></p><p>Pay-for-performance systems probably have only small benefits or make little or no difference to healthcare provider behaviour or patients' use of healthcare services. We are uncertain whether they cause harm. We are uncertain about the benefits and harms of other payments systems because the research is lacking or of very low certainty.</p><p><bold>What was studied in the review?</bold></p><p>Many healthcare services are offered to patients through outpatient facilities rather than to inpatients in hospitals. Outpatient facilities are also known as ambulatory care facilities, and include primary healthcare centres, outpatient clinics, urgent care centres, family planning centres, mental health centres, and dental clinics.</p><p>Different systems to reimburse outpatient (ambulatory) care facilities for their services are available to governments and health insurers. These systems include:</p><p>&#x02022; budget systems, where the facility is given a fixed amount of money in advance to cover expenses for a fixed period;</p><p>&#x02022; capitation payment systems, where the facility is paid a fixed amount of money in advance to provide specific services to each enrolled patient for a fixed period;</p><p>&#x02022; fee-for-service systems, where payment is based on the specific services that the healthcare facility provides;</p><p>&#x02022; pay-for-performance systems, where payment is partly based on the performance of the facility's healthcare providers.</p><p>Different payment systems can have different effects on how healthcare facilities deliver care. These changes can be intentional or unintentional and can lead to both benefits and harms. At best, a payment system can encourage healthcare providers to offer the right healthcare services to the right patients in the best and most cost-efficient way. However, payment systems can also lead providers to offer poor-quality, expensive, and unnecessary care, which can ultimately have a negative impact on patients' health.</p><p>This Cochrane review assessed the effect of different payment systems for outpatient care facilities. Other Cochrane reviews have assessed the effect of different payment systems for individual healthcare professionals and for inpatient facilities.</p><p><bold>Main results</bold></p><p>We found 21 relevant studies from the United Kingdom, the United States, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Afghanistan, China, and Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the studies were from primary healthcare facilities. The studies assessed capitation systems, fee-for-service systems, and different types of pay-for-performance systems.</p><p>Pay-for-performance systems:</p><p>&#x02022; probably slightly improve providers' use of some tests and treatments;</p><p>&#x02022; probably lead to little or no difference in providers' compliance with quality assurance criteria;</p><p>&#x02022; may lead to little or no difference in patients' use of health services;</p><p>&#x02022; may lead to little or no difference in patients' health status.</p><p>Capitation combined with a pay-for-performance system targeted at reducing antibiotic use probably slightly reduces antibiotic prescriptions when compared to a fee-for-service system.</p><p>Two studies compared capitation with fee-for-service systems, however, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low.</p><p>We did not find any relevant studies that assessed budget systems.</p><p><bold>How up-to-date is this review?</bold></p><p>We searched for studies that had been published up to March 2016.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Summary of findings for the main comparison</title><table-wrap id="tab1" position="float"><table frame="border" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>P4P plus some existing payment method compared with existing payment method for provision and patient outcomes</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>Patient or population:</bold> outpatient health facilities<break/>

They provide a variety of types of health care including preventive health care, treatment of acute illness, dental care, and some types of maternal and family-planning care. Most of these services are first-contact and basic healthcare services. The provision of outpatient care contributes to immediate and large gains in health status, and a large portion of total health expenditure goes to outpatient healthcare services, especially in low- and middle-income countries (<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">Berman 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the intervention</title><p>Based on Barnum's framework of "flow of funds under generic reforms" (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>), the flow of funds would typically be from the Ministry of Health to government providers, and from social or private insurers, if they exist, to providers. Different payment methods can be used for different outpatient care facilities (<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">Barnum 1995</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="CD011153-0001-f01"/></fig><p>The most commonly used payment systems to remunerate outpatient care facilities are budgets, capitation, fee-for-service, pay for performance, and mixed systems (<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">Barnum 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Langenbrunner 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b76" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2000</xref>).</p><sec><title>Line-item budgets</title><p>The allocation of a fixed amount of funds to a healthcare provider to cover specific line items (or input costs), such as personnel, utilities, medicines, and supplies, for a certain period of time (<xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Langenbrunner 2009</xref>). Line-item budgets are widely used in low- and middle-income countries and are often an important part of a centrally directed healthcare system (<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">Barnum 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Global budgets</title><p>A payment fixed in advance to cover aggregate expenditures for a given period. This method is used by government or insurers to pay hospitals (<xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">Hirdes 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b78" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe 1993</xref>), as well as some types of outpatient care facilities. For example, in 1996 the National Health Insurance program in Taiwan implemented a global budget payment system for clinics with the aim of reducing pharmaceutical expenditures (<xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr">Lee 2006</xref>). Global budgets can be an important element of health sector reforms such as decentralisation of the healthcare system.</p></sec><sec><title>Capitation</title><p>The provider is paid a predetermined fixed rate in advance to provide a defined set of services for each individual enrolled with the provider for a fixed period. Capitation payment may be a flat fee for each of the enrollees or it can be a risk-adjusted fee, based on the relative risk of the registered population. This payment method has been widely used in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. For example, in Thailand, capitation was used to motivate hospitals to provide comprehensive health services (<xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr">ILO/UNDP 1993</xref>); it was also used to pay primary care providers in Hungary (<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">Deeble 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Fee-for-service</title><p>Providers are reimbursed based on specific items provided. Fee-for-service, with fixed-fee schedules or without (unconstrained), is commonly used in such countries as Canada, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea; among private insurers in the Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia; in indemnity plans in the United States (a type of health insurance that reimburses the patient or provider as expenses are incurred) (<xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">Pati 2005</xref>); and in parts of Western Europe, such as Austria and Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Pay for performance</title><p>The payment is directly linked to the performance of healthcare providers. Pay for performance can be used to pay individuals, groups of people, or organisations by government or insurers. Pay-for-performance schemes vary widely in terms of the types of performance that are targeted, how performance is measured, when payments for performance are paid, the size of payments for performance, and the proportion of total reimbursements that is paid for performance (<xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Witter 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mixed systems</title><p>A mixed system may be adopted simply because it is administratively more practical or to counter the adverse incentives of specific payment methods while retaining their desirable features. Most provider payment systems are mixed.</p></sec><sec><title>Categories of payment methods</title><p>Provider payment methods can be categorised based on three characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab8">Table 8</xref>) (<xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Langenbrunner 2009</xref>):</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>whether payment rates to providers for a single service or a package of services are set prospectively (in advance) or retrospectively (after services are provided). For prospectively set payment methods, services are bundled into a package reimbursed at a fixed payment rate, and some financial risk is shifted from the purchaser to the provider. Alternatively, payment rates are set retrospectively when the provider is simply reimbursed the amount that is billed, the reimbursement rates reflect the cost of providing the services, and the purchaser bears all the financial risk;</p></list-item><list-item><p>whether payment to the provider is made prospectively (before services are provided) or retrospectively (after services are provided). With prospective rate setting, the actual payment may be made either prospectively or retrospectively;</p></list-item><list-item><p>whether the payment that is made to providers is based on inputs used to provide services (i.e. all costs of providing services are financed) or on outputs produced, such as cases treated, bed-days completed, or individual services provided (i.e. each test, procedure, or consultation).</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec><sec><title>How the intervention might work</title><p>Different types of payment methods have different incentives. Retrospective payment systems provide incentives to providers to deliver more services, and thereby might increase utilisation of services. There is little risk for providers, provided the payments are appropriate, and there are no incentives for patient selection. However, retrospective payment systems can also provide incentives to provide unnecessary and inappropriate care. Retrospective payments can also provide incentives to deliver desired services, thereby improving quality. In contrast, prospective payment methods can provide incentives to deliver rational levels of services, to improve efficiency, and to contain costs (<xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Langenbrunner 2009</xref>).</p><p>An input-based payment method creates incentives to increase the number of inputs. An output-based payment method creates stronger incentives to increase the number or quality of services delivered. The lower the levels of aggregation at which services are defined as outputs, the greater the incentives are to increase the number of services delivered.</p><p>Based on these theoretical incentives, different payment methods might be expected to have different effects on the quality and quantity of services provided per patient, the efficiency (cost per unit), and selection of patients (risk selection) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab9">Table 9</xref>).</p><p>Line-item budgets are input-based, whereas global budgets can be input- or output-based payments. Both are prospective, which means that providers have incentives to under-provide services (negative effects) and increase inputs, and no incentives to improve the efficiency of the input mix. The main incentive of global budgets is to encourage providers to control healthcare costs, rather than to improve performance.</p><p>Fee-for-service with a fixed-fee schedule and bundling of services is output-based, which provides incentives to increase the number of services delivered, including unnecessary ones (negative effects), and to reduce the amount of input per service. Fee-for-service with no fixed-fee schedule (unconstrained) is input-based and retrospective. The provider has incentives to increase the number of services and increase inputs.</p><p>Capitation is output-based and prospective. The provider has incentives to increase output or attract more patients to enrol, which increases the total payment received. Providers might attract enrollees through improved quality of care, additional services that are not typically covered, or other measures that patients may perceive as increasing the benefit of enrolling with that provider rather than with another provider. It also provides incentives to improve efficiency of the input mix and decrease inputs, focus on less expensive health promotion and prevention, and attempt to select healthier enrollees (negative effects).</p><p>Pay-for-performance is output-based and retrospectively paid for the providers. Providers are informed as to how much they could be paid with different levels of performance on service provision. It motivates the providers behaviour to the desired performance target, which could be the improvement in quantity or quality of services; however, it can also result in providers selecting the patients who are easier to achieve the performance target (e.g. blood pressure control) and ignoring the services that are not included in the performance target (negative effects).</p><p>Administrative costs are incurred whatever payment methods are used. Administrative costs include the costs of making payments and monitoring inputs, outputs (quantity and quality of services provided).

For interrupted time series (ITS) studies reporting time series data that are not appropriately analysed, we extracted and re-analysed the data as described in the EPOC resources for review authors (<xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">EPOC 2013b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</title><p>We used the EPOC suggested 'Risk of bias' criteria to assess the risk of bias for each outcome in all included studies (<xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">EPOC 2013c</xref>). For each criterion, two review authors independently described what was reported in the study, commented on the description, and judged the risk of bias. Any unresolved disagreements were discussed with a third review author, and, if consensus could not be reached, with the EPOC contact editor. We summarised the overall risk of bias across criteria for the primary outcome of the included studies. For randomised trials, non-randomised trials, and controlled before-after studies, we primarily considered four criteria: baseline outcome measurements, baseline characteristics measurements, incomplete outcome data addressed, and protection against contamination. If all four criteria were scored 'low risk of bias' for the outcome in a study, the summary assessment was that there was a low risk of bias; if one or more key criteria were scored 'unclear', the summary assessment was unclear risk of bias. If one or more key criteria were scored 'high risk of bias', the summary assessment was high risk of bias. For ITS studies, when we summarised the overall risk of bias across these criteria, we primarily considered the following criteria: intervention independence, intervention affecting data collection, and incomplete outcome data addressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures of treatment effect</title><p>For randomised trials, non-randomised trials, and controlled before-after studies, we recorded or calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. If adjusted analysis was done, we reported the effect estimates reported by the authors, also converting them into RRs when possible. For continuous outcomes, when possible, we reported the absolute change from a statistical analysis adjusted for baseline differences or the relative change adjusted for baseline differences in the outcome measures. If not enough data were provided for statistical analysis, we only reported the absolute and relative change adjusted for baseline differences.</p><p>For interrupted time series and repeated measures studies, we attempted to report the difference between the predicted value based on the pre-intervention trend and the estimated value based on the change in level and postintervention trend at relevant time points (including immediately after the intervention (change in level), one year, two years, and three years). However, in all included interrupted time series studies, only one paper provided enough data for us to calculate the above effect outcomes, so for other interrupted time series studies, we only used change in level immediately after intervention and change in trend to measure the treatment effects, or the effects results reported by the authors if any re-analysis was not possible.</p><p>We included five controlled before-after studies with very high risk of bias and unclear reporting for a large number of outcomes, but did not use them in effects analyses (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Bonfrer 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Canavan 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Rudasingwa 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Soeters 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Soeters 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Unit of analysis issues</title><p>We planned to re-analyse comparisons that allocated clusters (e.g. clinics in one district) but did not account for clustering, if we could extract the intracluster coefficient. However, all included studies adjusted for clustering in their analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Dealing with missing data</title><p>We contacted the original investigators to request missing data. At the time of submission of this review we had not received any response on missing data. We used the available data for those studies reporting the point estimate of effect measures without confidence intervals or, if that information was missing, we included the study in the review, but not in analyses of the effects of payment methods. If information on subgroup analyses was missing (e.g. for P4P, the size of the incentive or frequency of payment), we contacted the original investigators to request information. We received replies from two authors regarding P4P interventions. If we did not receive a response clarifying the P4P design, we did not include the study in subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of heterogeneity</title><p>We conducted meta-analysis to synthesise the effect measures of included studies if they had:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>similar intervention and comparison payment methods: the payment methods evaluated by all studies were defined as the same category of payment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>same participants: e.g. all targets of payment methods included were primary care clinics or practices;</p></list-item><list-item><p>same category of outcome measures: e.g. all outcome measures were health service provision measures, or all were patient outcome measures.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>When the included studies were similar enough based on the above criteria, we used the Chi<sup>2</sup> test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. When the P value from a Chi<sup>2</sup> test was smaller than 0.1, we interpreted this as an indication that the observed difference in results across studies was unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.</p><p>We used the random-effects model for meta-analysis across studies, because the payment methods included several components; the payment methods conducted by different purchasers or in different areas were not exactly the same; and the effectiveness of payment methods may also have been influenced by many contextual factors that varied in different studies. In addition, the outcome measures under the same category were not exactly the same in different studies.</p><p>We explored heterogeneity in the design of payment methods through prespecified subgroup analyses. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for results from meta-analyses with high levels of heterogeneity without a compelling explanation for the heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of reporting biases</title><p>We planned to use funnel plots to examine asymmetry and assess the potential of any asymmetry being due to publication bias.

We firstly categorised the comparisons and outcomes, and then described the effects of different kinds of payment methods on different categories of outcomes. We also listed and described the differences in context and components of payment methods in different studies. We considered the potential influence of these factors on the effects of the payment methods in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4">Discussion</xref>. We planned on using meta-analysis if we found more than one study with similar comparisons and outcomes. Only three randomised trials, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Bardach 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Engineer 2016</xref>, and <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Petersen 2013</xref>, and one controlled before-after study, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">Basinga 2011</xref>, were similar enough and provided sufficient data for a meta-analysis. For these studies, we firstly used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis within a study, if the study included more than one outcome in the same category of outcome measures (service provision measures or patients outcome measures). We then used the random-effects model for meta-analysis across studies. If the data for meta-analysis were not available in some studies, we calculated the median and interquartile range of effect sizes, if there was a sufficient number of included studies. We reported RRs for dichotomous outcomes and the relative change for continuous outcomes.</p><p>For the synthesised effects of each comparison, we assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome(i.e. the extent of our confidence in the estimate of effect across studies) using the GRADE approach (<xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">Guyatt 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</title><p>Based on the incentives of different reimbursement systems for outpatient care facilities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab9">Table 9</xref>), in the protocol for this review we hypothesised and analysed the following factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab10">Table 10</xref>) that might affect the size of effects of payment methods to explain any differences in the effects of payment methods.</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Larger fees: Relative increase in fees.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Duration of follow-up: When outcomes are measured relative to when the change was made.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ownership: For-profit versus not-for-profit ownership.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Multiple providers: Choice of providers available to patients versus little or no choice of providers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Monitoring: Monitoring versus no monitoring of the delivery of services.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Of the three kinds of comparisons included in this review, there were enough studies for conducting subgroup analysis for only one comparison (between P4P plus existing capitation or input-based payment with the existing payment method). Especially for the P4P, we hypothesised and analysed the following factors that might affect the size of effects of P4P payment to explain any differences in the effects of payment methods; these factors and hypothesis were based on the dimensions of P4P schemes defined by Conrad and Perry and the analysis of results-based financing by Oxman (<xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">Conrad 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr">Oxman 2009</xref>).</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Type of performance measures applied by P4P: service provision measures, patient outcome measures, or combined measures (P4P with provision measures leads to larger effects because provision behaviour is easier to change).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Type of performance target applied by P4P: threshold payment, or pay for each instance of service (P4P with pay for each instance of service leads to larger effects because one instance of service is easier to achieve).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Size of incentive (percentage of P4P payment on total income level): lower than 10%, 10% to 30%, higher than 30% (the larger the size, the larger the effects).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Frequency of monitoring and feedback: quarterly, annual (the more frequently the monitoring and feedback, the larger the effects).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Frequency of payment: quarterly, annual (the more frequently the payment, the larger the effects).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Resourcing: involvement of extra fund or not (involvement of extra fund leads to larger effects because of the support of extra resources).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Individual payment inside facility: no payment to individual, equally allocated to individual, or allocated to individual based on individual performance (allocation to individual based on individual performance leads to larger effects because individual health workers are more motivated).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Duration of follow-up: 1 year or less, 1.5 to 2 years, 3 years (larger effects with shorter follow-up because changes and adjustments over time might reduce the initial incentive).</p></list-item></list>

There are two main categories in the included P4P methods: threshold payment and payment for each instance of performance. Threshold payment means that the providers only received the performance incentives if they achieved a certain level of performance, and this level of performance could be absolute performance or relative performance compared with other providers or their previous performance, for example at least 40% of covered patients with diabetes who have a record of total cholesterol (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Alshamsan 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Lee 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Serumaga 2011</xref>), the outpatient utilisation rate achieving at least 0.6 per resident and the facility-based delivery achieving at least 20/1000 (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Canavan 2008</xref>), referral of at least 50 smokers (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">An 2008</xref>), percentage of tobacco status identified achieving 15% above the average performance (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Roski 2003</xref>), or being one of six facilities with the highest compliance scores or one of three facilities improving the most from a previous audit (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Hillman 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Hillman 1999</xref>). Payment for each instance of performance means providers received an award for each instance of service provision or patient's health improvement, for example payment of USD 20 for one case of blood pressure control (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Bardach 2013</xref>), USD 15 for one glycated haemoglobin test (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Chien 2012</xref>), or USD 18.20 payment for one blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Petersen 2013</xref>).

Originally, eight blocks were randomised into two comparison groups, and one group in each block was randomly assigned to the intervention group. However, before implementation of the baseline survey, the administrative district boundaries were redefined by the government in a decentralisation process. As a result, some of the districts selected for this study were combined with districts that already had existing P4P schemes. Consequently, the researchers had to switch the assignment (intervention or control) for eight districts from four blocks, and add one block to the sample. Due to the unclear allocation process and changed allocation, we grouped and analysed this study as a controlled before-after study. Despite the change of allocation, the intervention and control groups were comparable in terms of the main characteristics and outcomes measured at baseline, so we rated this study as a controlled before-after study with a low risk of bias.</p><p>We assessed five other included controlled before-after studies as being at high risk of bias (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Bonfrer 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Canavan 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Rudasingwa 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Soeters 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Soeters 2011</xref>; ). The main issue with these studies was that the control areas had very different characteristics from the intervention areas.

If we included all four studies in the primary analysis, the adjusted RR for improvement in service utilisation <underline>across the four studies</underline> ranged from 0.96 to 1.15 (median = 1.01).</p><p>Two randomised trials reported one continuous outcome related to utilisation of services (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">An 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Engineer 2016</xref>). <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">An 2008</xref> found that the overall percentage of smokers who were enrolled in a quit line service was higher in intervention clinics (3.0%) compared with control clinics (1.3%; relative change without adjusting for baseline being 131%, P = 0.005). <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Engineer 2016</xref> evaluated the effects of P4P on the equity of health service utilisation by measuring concentration index (an index measuring the extent to which a health indicator is concentrated among the disadvantaged or the advantaged). The concentration index score ranges from -1 to 1 with 0 meaning the total equity. Given that a population is ranked by increasing socioeconomic status, the concentration index has a negative value when the health indicator is concentrated among the disadvantaged, and has a positive value when the health indicator is concentrated among the advantaged. They found that there was little or no change in the inequity level for the institutional deliveries (concentration index increased by 75.7% from a baseline level of 0.1000 (P = 0.3)) and children's utilisation of outpatient services (concentration index decreased by 46.81% from baseline level of 0.0047 (P = 0.98)).</p><p>One trial's outcomes were related to health outcomes (proportion of patients with blood pressure control and proportion of general population with cholesterol control) (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Bardach 2013</xref>). In this study, the adjusted RR for improvement in patients' health outcomes was 1.01 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig301">Analysis 3.1</xref>).</p><p>One ITS study, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Serumaga 2011</xref>, and two RM studies, <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Alshamsan 2012</xref> and <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Lee 2011</xref>, reported the immediate level change after the intervention and the change in trend after intervention for patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab15">Table 15</xref>). <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Serumaga 2011</xref> evaluated the effects of P4P incentive on quality of care and outcomes among patients in the United Kingdom with hypertension in primary care. This study included patient utilisation and patient health outcomes: the percentage of patients with blood pressure measured, the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure, and the percentage of patients with hypertension-related adverse outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, heart failure). It found that there was little or no change in levels and change trends of these outcome measures before and after the P4P scheme. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Alshamsan 2012</xref> evaluated the same P4P scheme in the United Kingdom on diabetes patients&#x02019; systolic blood pressure level, diastolic blood pressure level, total cholesterol level, and glycated haemoglobin level. It found that the introduction of this P4P scheme was associated with an initial reduction in systolic blood pressure level, and that this improvement was sustained over the three years following the P4P scheme. The P4P was also associated with an initial reduction in cholesterol level, but this reduction was not sustained, and this P4P scheme had little or no effect on diastolic blood pressure level and glycated haemoglobin level. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Lee 2011</xref> also evaluated this P4P scheme in the United Kingdom on stroke, hypertension, and management of coronary heart disease (CHD), and found that the scheme resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure level and diastolic blood pressure level for hypertension patients immediately after the start of the P4P scheme, but this reduction was only sustained for the systolic blood pressure level. This study found that the P4P scheme had little or no impact on other health outcome measures, including systolic blood pressure level and diastolic blood pressure level for CHD patients, total cholesterol level for CHD patients, systolic blood pressure level and diastolic blood pressure level for stroke patients, and total cholesterol level for stroke patients. Another RM study reported insufficient data for re-analysis to obtain the change in level and change in trend for outcome measures (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Chien 2012</xref>). It found that immediately after the intervention there was little or no change in the rate of patients receiving glycated haemoglobin testing, the rate of patients receiving lipid testing, and the rate of patients receiving dilated eye examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect on healthcare provider outcomes</title><p>No relevant healthcare provider outcomes were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect on cost</title><p>Only <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">An 2008</xref> reported the cost of implementing the P4P program for referral of smokers to telephone counselling. The results showed that the P4P intervention costs were greater than usual care costs without P4P incentives by USD 86,796 in total. In return for these costs, intervention clinics provided 1042 additional referrals of smokers to telephone counselling that resulted in 289 additional enrollees. The marginal cost for the intervention clinics was therefore USD 83 per additional referral to telephone counselling and USD 300 per additional enrollee to quit line services (low-certainty evidence) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Unintended or adverse effects</title><p>Four studies reported some unintended or adverse effects. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Petersen 2013</xref> found that after the P4P intervention had ended, there was a significant reduction in blood pressure control and appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure in the intervention group compared with the control group (low-certainty evidence) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect on secondary outcomes</title><p>No relevant secondary outcomes were reported.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Comparison 2: Capitation plus P4P versus FFS</title><p>We included one study in this comparison (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Yip 2014</xref>), which found that capitation plus P4P probably slightly improved antibiotic use, which was the performance target for the P4P (moderate-certainty evidence) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The intervention in this study was a payment reform aimed at improving the quality of services provided by primary health providers in rural China. The performance target was designed to control antibiotics use. This intervention was applied by the New Rural Cooperative Medical Insurance (NCMS), the major health insurance for rural residents in China. In intervention areas, NCMS changed its traditional FFS to the capitated budget based on the number of NCMS enrollees for each health facility, and at the beginning of every year the NCMS disbursed 70% of the budget to the health centres, withholding the balance until after performance assessments at the middle and end of the year.

This study used three provision outcomes: the number of people receiving outpatient treatment, the number of very young (less than 5 years old) children in treatment, and the number of children receiving treatment for disruptive behaviour, because the author assumed that capitation incentivised providers to detect health problems in children of a younger age and with a less serious status, so that more serious episodes and more expensive treatment were reduced.

We found evidence to suggest that extra P4P incentives probably slightly improved the use of some tests and treatments by health providers, but likely lead to little or no difference in adherence to quality assurance criteria. We also found that P4P incentives may lead to little or no difference in patients' utilisation of health services or health outcomes. One study found that adding a P4P scheme to an existing payment method may lead to higher costs than the existing payment method (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">An 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Capitation combined with P4P compared to FFS</title><p>We included only one study in this comparison. The P4P was mainly targeted at controlling antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient visits. Compared with FFS, a capitated budget combined with payment based on providers' performance on antibiotic prescriptions and patient satisfaction probably slightly reduced antibiotic prescriptions in primary health facilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Capitation compared to FFS</title><p>This intervention targeted mental health centres in the included studies and aimed to motivate health providers to provide more outpatient and preventive services to control overall costs. The effects of capitation compared to FFS based on this evidence were uncertain, because the certainty of this evidence was very low.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</title><p>The health facilities in the studies included in this review all provided primary health care or mental health care. We found no evidence on dental clinics. This review covered most payment methods for outpatient health facilities other than budget payment. However, we identified only three comparisons. For the comparison of P4P added to an existing capitation or an input-based payment method versus the existing payment method, four of the primary outcomes were reported in one or more studies: service provision, patient outcomes, costs, and adverse effects. However, only one study reported costs, no studies reported provider outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was low for utilisation of health services and patient outcomes. These studies were from low-, middle-, and high-income countries.</p><p>Nearly all of the P4P programs included extra funding in addition to the change in the payment method. It is thus unclear to what extent the effects of these P4P programs on service provision can be attributed to the increase in resources, and it is uncertain whether P4P programs that do not include extra funding would have similar effects. In addition, information on how the incentive payments were used inside the health facilities was lacking in some of the included studies. Since P4P is intended to improve targeted behaviours through financial incentives, it is uncertain to what extent the way in which incentive payments were used influenced the effects of the P4P programs that were evaluated, and it would be difficult to replicate (or know how to improve) this component of the programs.</p><p>The countries in which the included studies were conducted had well-developed electronic records or insurance claim data (in high-income countries) or specially designed data systems for evaluating the effects of P4P programs (in low- and middle-income countries). Unavailability of an electronic information system or resources to support the administrative cost of P4P will limit its use.</p><p>The studies comparing capitation combined with P4P to FFS, or capitation to FFS were conducted in one country (China or the United States), so the evidence base is incomplete, and the findings may have limited applicability in other settings.</p><sec><title>Subgroup analysis</title><p>We included more than one study evaluating the effects of P4P on service provision, utilisation, and health outcomes. Four included studies evaluated utilisation outcomes, but one study did not report the design of P4P components clearly (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Roski 2003</xref>), leaving only three studies for subgroup analysis of the effects of P4P on service provision (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab17">Table 17</xref>). Due to the limited number of studies and multiple differences between the P4P programs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab11">Table 11</xref>), we were unable to conduct meaningful subgroup comparisons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab17">Table 17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Certainty of the evidence</title><p>The certainty of the evidence for the effects of adding P4P to an existing payment method on the provision of services (use of tests or treatments) was moderate because of study limitations. We assessed only one study as having low risk of bias. Common problems among the studies included: no clear description of the random allocation method or factors uncontrolled by researchers (policy change) influencing the initial random allocation, and no baseline outcomes and characteristics for small numbers of facilities that were randomly allocated. The certainty of the evidence for adherence to quality criteria was also moderate due to heterogeneity. Only one study provided four specific patient health outcomes. The certainty of this evidence on health outcomes was low because of the risk of bias and uncertainty about the applicability of the evidence outside of the setting in which the study was done (small primary health clinics in the United States) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The certainty of the evidence for the effects of capitation combined with P4P compared to FFS on provision of services was moderate because there was only one randomised trial with unclear of risk of bias and uncertainty about the applicability of the evidence outside of the setting in which the study was done (primary healthcare facilities in rural China) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The certainty of the evidence for the effects of capitation compared to FFS on the provision of services, health outcomes, and costs was very low because of the risk of bias. We included only two ITS studies in mental health centres in the United States in this comparison. The studies used different data sources before and after the intervention (Medicaid fee-for-service claims before and a shadow billing system after) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Potential biases in the review process</title><p>We carried out an extensive search to ensure that we identified all relevant studies, but it remains possible that we could have missed some unpublished studies. We contacted the authors of relevant studies to clarify some questions on the design of payment methods and research results, and for finding additional and ongoing studies, but at the time of submission of this review we had received a reply from the author of only one study.</p></sec><sec><title>Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</title><p>Current reviews on payment are focused on payments to individual health professionals (<xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">Gosden 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">Houle 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Witter 2012</xref>), and there are no reviews on payments to facilities. However, there are several reviews on the effectiveness of P4P that overlap with this review (<xref rid="b73" ref-type="bibr">Petersen 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr">Schatz 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">Scott 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Witter 2012</xref>). There are two reasons for overlap. One is that some reviews targeted one type of payment intervention (e.g. P4P) but did not constrain the level of payment (individual or facility) (<xref rid="b73" ref-type="bibr">Petersen 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">Scott 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Witter 2012</xref>). The other is that one review focused on payment to health professionals (<xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">Scott 2011</xref>), but also included payment to practices or physician groups. We found that some studies asserted that the payment methods they evaluated were to health professionals or physicians (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Engineer 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Hillman 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Hillman 1999</xref>), but that the payment was actually based on performance of a facility or physician group. In this situation, only part of the payment is allocated to individual health professionals, or all of the payment is allocated to individuals but not allocated based on individuals' behaviours. The mechanism of how these payments affect behaviours may be different from how direct payments to individuals affect behaviours. Our review included all payment methods to facilities and excluded direct payments to individuals.</p><p>Regarding the Cochrane reviews that overlap with our review (<xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">Scott 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Witter 2012</xref>), we contacted the authors, compared our data extraction, and discussed any disagreements. For several controlled before-after studies from low-income countries included in the <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Witter 2012</xref> review (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Canavan 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Soeters 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Soeters 2011</xref>), we included them only for description and not for effects analysis. We only included studies with low or unclear risk of bias in our analysis, as this provides better evidence to analyse the effects. For the comparison of P4P plus an existing payment method to the existing payment method, other reviews all found that the effects of P4P varied in direction and size (<xref rid="b73" ref-type="bibr">Petersen 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr">Schatz 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">Scott 2011</xref>), so that it was difficult to draw general conclusions. Different from those reviews, we categorised outcome measures into provision outcomes, utilisation outcomes, and health outcomes, based on the extent of control of health providers on these outcomes, and attempted to draw conclusions on the effects of P4P at the facility level on each category of outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' conclusions</title><sec><title>Implications for practice</title><p>If policymakers are considering the use of pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives to pay outpatient health facilities, our review found that this intervention will probably lead to a slight improvement in service delivery, such as the use of tests or treatments for controlling risk factors for chronic diseases, but may lead to little or no improvement in utilisation of health services or health outcomes. We did not find a relationship between the design components of P4P and its effectiveness due to the limited number of included studies for subgroup analysis, and the costs and effects of adding P4P to an existing payment method are uncertain. The effects of using P4P without additional resources is also uncertain.</p><p>The effects of other payment methods are uncertain due to very low certainty or a lack of evidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for research</title><p>The majority of studies included in this review are from high-income countries, and there is a need for well-designed research into payment methods for outpatient health facilities in low- and middle-income countries. There is also a need for more well-designed studies to directly compare or evaluate the effects of differences in the design of P4P and other payment methods. Future research should evaluate the costs of changes in payment methods as well as the effects, since some payment interventions, like P4P, involve more resources for an increase of the payment level and entail administrative costs for performance assessment and management. Current evidence on the efficiency of P4P is scarce and inconclusive (<xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">Emmert 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This review was funded by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, World Health Organization and National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403008).

After each assessment, the county NCMS office compared the performance score for each township health centre to the average score in the county.

Each centre that scored below the average received less than the 30%, in proportion to how much lower than average its score was.
