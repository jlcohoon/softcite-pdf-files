In the current study, chili pepper fruit wound inoculated <italic>in planta</italic> with <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra formed necrotic lesions on the fruit surface and induced several structural and chemical barriers systemically in the fruit tissue. The initial defense response included programmed cell death of necrotizing and necrotized cells, which was characterized by nuclear DNA cleavage, as detected by TUNEL-confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and phosphatidylserine exposure on cell walls distal to the infection site, as detected by Annexin V FLUOS-CLSM. These two responses may facilitate cell killing and enhance transportation of cell wall materials used for cell wall thickening, respectively. The cells beneath the necrotic tissue were enlarged and divided to form periclinal cell walls, resulting in extensive formation of several parallel boundary layers at the later stages of infection, accompanying the deposition of wall fortification materials for strengthening structural defenses. These results suggest that nonhost resistance of chili pepper fruit against the nonhost necrotrophic pathogen <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra is activated systematically from the initial infection until termination of the infection cycle, resulting in complete inhibition of bacterial pathogenesis by utilizing organ-specific <italic>in situ</italic> physiological events governed by the expression of genes in the plant fruit organ.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chili pepper</kwd><kwd>hypersensitive response</kwd><kwd>programmed cell death</kwd><kwd><italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>glycines</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Plants have evolved a variety of barriers preformed or induced after pathogen infection to defend themselves.

Host plants can be resistant to pathogens that are virulent to other host plants in the same species by <italic>R</italic>-gene-mediated resistance. This type of resistance is often governed genetically by one major gene that can be easily invalidated by pathogens newly evolved, with the corresponding avirulence (<italic>Avr</italic>) genes modified or removed (<xref rid="b33-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">McDowell and Woffenden, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b48-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Vera Cruz et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, non-host resistance is a broad-spectrum plant defense resulting in all members of a plant species being immune to all isolates of microorganisms pathogenic to other plant species, which is assumed to be controlled by multiple genes that are not easy to circumvent, thus providing durable disease resistance (<xref rid="b14-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Ham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b17-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Holub and Cooper, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b41-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Senthil-Kumar and Mysore, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Programmed cell death (PCD) is a typical resistance response that results from host-parasite interactions of specific plant resistance and the pathogen&#x02019;s avirulence genes, leading to a hypersensitive response (HR) (<xref rid="b13-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b15-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Heath, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b22-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b31-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Lord and Gunawardena, 2012</xref>). This is also a key feature of nonhost plant resistance at the initial inoculation site, especially against biotrophic pathogens whose survival and growth depend on utilizing living host plant tissue as a nutritional source (<xref rid="b16-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Hof et al., 2014</xref>). However, the resulting HR after PCD does little to affect necrotrophic pathogens that are capable of utilizing organic materials derived from decaying or dead cells. To combat these types of pathogens, a subsequent defense response is required to fully inhibit their infection process (<xref rid="b24-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b43-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Strange, 1998</xref>).

Chili pepper leaves infiltrated with <italic>Xag</italic> suspensions also form necrotic lesions, and electron microscopy of infected leaf tissues has been used to confirm subcellular changes related to HR. These are characterized by separation of the plasma membrane from the cell wall, formation of cell wall apposition, and cellular necrosis (<xref rid="b21-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2002</xref>). However, resistance responses other than HR have not been documented in the nonhost defense response of other organs of the chili pepper against necrotrophic pathogen infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the initial and latestage histopathological responses of the chili pepper fruit to <italic>Xag</italic> infection to better understand the overall defense mechanisms of a nonhost plant in response to a necrotrophic bacterial pathogen.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strain, host plant and inoculation</title><p>The bacterial strain used in this study was a wild type strain (8ra) of <italic>Xag</italic> (<italic>Xag</italic> 8ra) and had been used in a previous study (<xref rid="b21-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra was grown on yeast extract calcium carbonate (YDC) agar at 28&#x000b0;C for 3 days prior to use.

To detect nuclear DNA cleavage using the TUNEL assay, fruit sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) for 20 minutes, rinsed with PBS, then incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 (in 0.1% aqueous sodium citrate) for 2 minutes at 2&#x000b0;C to 8&#x000b0;C on ice for permeabilization. Next, sections were rinsed twice with PBS and added along with 50 &#x003bc;l TUNEL reaction mixture to the sections and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 minutes in a humidified chamber. To detect PS exposure by Annexin-V FLOUS assay, fruit sections were fixed with a freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution (4% in PBS) followed by 100 &#x003bc;l Annexin-V fluorescein solution (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) in HEPES buffer and incubated at 15&#x000b0;C to 25&#x000b0;C for 10 to 15 minutes, followed by DNA staining of the sections for 10 to 15 minutes with propidium iodide, which is not permeable to live cells (<xref rid="b36-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Nicoletti et al., 1991</xref>).

Other infected tissues were excised and fixed in Karnovsky&#x02019;s fixative in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 hours. The fixed fruit tissues were rinsed in the same buffer solution three times each for 20 minutes and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 hours.

These semi-thin sections were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue O and observed under a compound light microscope (Axiophot). The embedded samples were sectioned at 80 to 90 nm thickness with a diamond knife on an MT-X ultra-microtome to make ultrathin sections, which were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate for 7 minutes each and examined under a JEM-1010 electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV.

Likewise, these signals were absent immediately following pathogen inoculation (data not shown). TUNEL-positive nuclear signals were rarely observed in pepper fruit tissues by 12 to 18 hours after pathogen inoculation (data not shown), but were found extensively in epidermal and sub-epidermal cells in and around the inoculation sites by 24 hours after wound inoculation (<xref rid="f2-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref>).

Using LM, we confirmed that pepper fruit tissues affected by infection contained necrotic or necrotizing cells and modified cells with vacuolated intact cytoplasm in their vicinity, often demarcated by necrotic cell walls (<xref rid="f3-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Using TEM, we observed that the necrotic and necrotizing cells were characterized by a shrunken degenerating cytoplasm separated from the degenerated necrotic cell walls (<xref rid="f3-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Nuclear features were homogeneously heterochromatic at 1 hours after inoculation (<xref rid="f3-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), and by 24 to 60 hours after inoculation, had proliferated with aggregated heterochromatic materials distributed randomly in the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="f3-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>).

For instance, the cytoplasmic contents of cells adjacent to necrotic cells had increased numbers of vacuoles due to cytoplasmic infiltration, indicated by proliferous cytoplasmic fragmentations 3 days after inoculation (<xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Around this time, some cells adjacent to the necrotic cells contained a dense cytoplasm with numerous small vacuoles, similar to meristematic cells, likely derived from the large vacuoles breaking down due to the infiltration of increased cytoplasmic contents (<xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). By LM, we observed that the affected cells bounding with and separated by the thickened necrotic cell wall and middle lamella from the necrotic cytoplasm contained an intact cytoplasm with the parallel cell walls, which were often significantly thickened (<xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Likewise, by TEM, we found that numerous small vacuoles were produced in the intact dense cytoplasm, which appeared to be incorporated into the thickened cell wall, probably depositing cell wall materials onto the cell wall to increase cell wall thickness (<xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). At later stages of infection, these structural changes resulted in confinement of the bacterial cells in lysigenous intercellular spaces surrounded by thickened cell walls that were separated from the necrotic cytoplasm, consequently protecting the adjacent and bounding cells from degeneration (<xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Later defense-related structural changes and deposition of cell wall fortification materials in pepper fruit tissues infected with <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra</title><p>Following control wound inoculation, there were no subsequent defense-related structural changes observed in fruit tissues (data not shown).

However, 4 days after inoculation, the cells beneath the necrotic tissue were enlarged with few cell divisions (<xref rid="f5-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), and the cell divisions occurred in a series of cells, forming paralleled periclinal walls.

The cell walls at the bottom of the inoculated wound had accumulated cell wall fortification materials 4 days after inoculation (<xref rid="f5-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, G</xref>), and by 15 days following inoculation, this accumulation had become extensive.

Together, these observations support the premise that nuclear DNA cleavage in cells with PCD is an efficient way to kill cells.</p><p>Contrary to the function of nuclear DNA cleavage in PCD, PS exposure on the outer plasma membrane leaflet (via loss of phospholipid asymmetry) in mammalian cells is responsible for signaling the PCD process to the environment, resulting in the removal of dead cell materials often by phagocytic uptake of macrophages (<xref rid="b8-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b46-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">van Engeland et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="b47-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). However, the role of PS exposure is not well-documented in PCD of plant cells, although the regulation of transmembrane bilayer lipid asymmetry is important in plant cell physiology, such as adaptation of plants to cold (<xref rid="b11-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Gom&#x000e8;s et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we used LM with Annexin-V FLUOS or toluidine blue O staining and TEM to evaluate <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra-infected pepper tissues. Our results demonstrate that PS exposure occurred mainly at the cell walls distal to the infection site, bounding occurred with thickened necrotized cell walls, and the middle lamella adjacent to modified cells with an intact cytoplasm contained numerous small vacuoles and thickened cell walls to which vesicles were incorporated at subsequent infection stages (<xref rid="f2-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, F</xref>, <xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">4A&#x02013;D</xref>). These thickened cell walls may play a key role in the structural defense against pathogen invasion into the inner pepper fruit tissues as well as inhibit virulence factors transferred into adjacent healthy cells. These observations also suggest that the contents of apoptotic fruit cells may not be eliminated totally as in mammalian cells, but instead may be partially used for secondary cell wall thickening being fortified by the deposition of defense-related materials such as lignin, suberin and cutin, resulting in shrunken cellular remains that are condensed in lysigenous intercellular spaces (as shown in <xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, the loss of membrane asymmetry caused by PS exposure may enhance the transportation of primers for cell wall materials through the plasma membrane to the cell wall where polymerization with their primers occurs (<xref rid="b30-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kolattukudy, 1996</xref>). Therefore, the membrane alterations in pepper fruit infected with <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra may not only be related to PCD processes but also to preliminary factors for the formation of structural and chemical barriers to inhibit the spread of disease.</p><p>In host plants, wounding stimulates the formation of boundary layers such as the wound periderm and abscission layer as well as the deposition of lignin and suberin into boundary layers; however, these formations are enhanced significantly following inoculation of incompatible hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens (<xref rid="b27-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Kim, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b24-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b26-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="b23-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="b40-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Rittinger et al., 1987</xref>). In the current study, the nonhost chili pepper plant had boundary layer formations that were remarkably enhanced following inoculation of the nonhost necrotrophic pathogen <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra. Enhancement of these structural defenses in the chili pepper fruit may be due to a residual effect of prior PCD responses, especially the PS exposure that leads to enhanced cell wall formation and fortification, as discussed above. This may also be true for enhanced structural changes observed at the later stages of the incompatible host-pathogen interactions mentioned above, suggesting there may be no fundamental phenotypic differences in inhibiting the infection processes of necrotrophic (or hemibiotrophic) pathogens in nonhost plants and incompatible host plants during the later stages of infection.</p><p>Nonhost plants may defend themselves against bacterial foliar pathogens by restricting the initial three-step infection process. This process begins with the initial pathogen entry, then multiplication in the apoplast and finally direct interaction with plant cells in which HR and HR-related defenses are induced in the cytosol, nucleus, plasma membrane, and cellular organelles (<xref rid="b41-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Senthil-Kumar and Mysore, 2013</xref>). Ultrastructural changes related to HR have been observed in pepper leaf tissues infected with <italic>Xag</italic>, but no boundary layer was formed to inhibit further pathogen invasion; however, bacterial cells were embedded in wall materials and cemented to plant cell walls at early infection stages (<xref rid="b21-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2002</xref>), which implies that inhibition for further bacterial invasion is not required. In contrast to these observations, in the current study, <italic>Xag</italic> cells gathered together within the intercellular spaces derived from cellular breakdown, but no bacterial cells were embedded in wall materials that were cemented to the cell wall to immobilize (<xref rid="f4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). This indicates that bacterial cells can activate the infection process, including pathogen invasion, for which additional defenses must be required to inhibit. These different defense responses in pepper fruit and pepper leaves may be related to differences in physiological incompatibility governed mostly by preformed defense structures as well as antimicrobial substances and/or nutrients secreted onto plant organ surfaces and in apoplastic regions (<xref rid="b4-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b5-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Cowan, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b9-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b34-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Melotto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b39-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Rico and Preston, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b41-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Senthil-Kumar and Mysore, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b49-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The development of different organs and tissue types is governed by the selective expression of distinct fractions of the genome, resulting in the physiologically incompatible differences between the pepper fruit and pepper leaf (<xref rid="b32-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2005</xref>). Plant organs that are known to form boundary layers in response to necrotrophic pathogen infections are chili pepper fruit (<xref rid="b24-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b26-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), ginseng root (<xref rid="b20-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Jeon and Kim, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b23-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2009</xref>), cactus stem (<xref rid="b27-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Kim, 2002</xref>), and peach bark (<xref rid="b3-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Biggs, 1989</xref>), all of which are secondarily grown organs in which meristematic cells are regenerated to produce the secondary state of tissues (e.g., periderm) related to the boundary layers (e.g., wound periderm) (<xref rid="b2-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Biggs, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="b7-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Esau, 1977</xref>). All of these observations suggest that the nonhost defense response of the chili pepper fruit is dynamic and utilizes physiological events <italic>in situ</italic> that are governed during organ development by the enhanced expression of genes, probably for pathogenesis-related proteins that are required for PCD (<xref rid="b25-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Hwang, 2015</xref>) and key enzymes in cell wall-building processes, including lignin formation (<xref rid="b44-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">Taheri and Tarighi, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b45-ppj-32-311" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, nonhost resistance of the chili pepper fruit against <italic>Xag</italic> 8ra infection is activated systematically from the initial infection until termination of the infection cycle, initially inducing PCD and PCD-related defense structures leading to HR and cell wall thickening due to nuclear aberration and PS exposure, respectively, and later in the infection process inducing boundary layer formation beneath the infection site as a structural barrier against further pathogen invasion. Defense-related materials such as lignin, suberin and cutin were deposited onto the thickened and necrotized cell walls, thereby strengthening the cell wall structures. It is probable that this systematic resistant response may be required for the chili pepper fruit, a complicated plant storage organ with comparably lower physiological activity, to resist infections by necrotrophic bacterial pathogens that benefit from cell death.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ppj-32-311"><p>Articles can be freely viewed online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

The inoculated fruit tissue (A) contained necrotic or necrotizing cells (NC) along with highly vacuolated (VC) adjacent cells with necrotized cell walls (arrows). The necrotic or NC (B) were characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage indicated by separation (S) of the cytoplasm (Cy) from the degenerated cell wall (DW). Initially (C), nuclear (N) features in the inoculated tissues were homogeneously heterochromatic. In later stages (D&#x02013;G), these features continued to accumulate condensed heterochromatin materials (Ch) that were distributed in the nucleoplasm and finally dispersed in the necrotized cytoplasm (NCy) and in necrotizing (E, F) and necrotized cells (G). Cellular organelles such as plastids (P) and mitochondria (M) in (B), (E) and (F) appeared degenerated, indicating cytoplasmic degeneration.

The cells (A) bounding with the necrotic cell contained an intact cytoplasm (ICy) with parallel thin (W) and thick cell walls (TW), around which the incorporation of vesicles (arrows) likely containing cell wall materials into the cell wall to increase cell wall thickening (asterisk) in (B) was observed. The cytoplasms of the cells adjacent to the necrotic cells became dense with cytoplasmic infiltration into the vacuole (V), as indicated by cytoplasmic fragmentation (CF) (C), resulting in a dense cytoplasm with numerous small vacuoles like meristematic cells (D). In (E), structural features at a later stage of infection are evident, showing the freely gathered bacterial cells (Bc) confined in intercellular spaces surrounded by thickened cell walls (TW) that were separated (S) from the NCy, thus protecting the cytoplasm (Cy) from degeneration. In (E), additionally thickened cell walls are noted by arrows. B, inclusion body; M, mitochondria; P, plastids.
